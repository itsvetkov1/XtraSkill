- **Scope:** AI-powered hybrid mobile/web application for business requirements discovery and documentation generation

---

## Executive Summary

The **Business Analyst Assistant (BA Assistant)** is a hybrid mobile and web application that augments business analysts during feature discovery meetings. The system provides AI-powered conversational assistance to explore requirements, proactively identify edge cases, and generate structured business documentation (user stories, acceptance criteria, requirements documents) on demand.

The primary business objective is to reduce time spent on requirement documentation while improving completeness through AI-assisted discovery conversations that systematically explore edge cases and generate production-ready artifacts. Target users are business analysts working in product development, requirements gathering, and stakeholder management roles who need to capture rough feature ideas and convert them into structured documentation.

Expected business value includes 50-70% reduction in documentation time per meeting, improved requirement completeness through AI-prompted edge case discovery, and consistent artifact quality across all BA team members regardless of experience level. The cross-platform design supports desktop preparation, mobile in-meeting use, and seamless sync across devices.

---

## Business Context

Business analysts currently face significant challenges in requirements gathering: manual transcription during meetings divides attention, edge cases are frequently missed until development, documentation quality varies by analyst experience, and converting rough notes to formal artifacts is time-consuming. These inefficiencies extend project timelines, increase rework during development, and frustrate stakeholders who receive inconsistent deliverables.

Market drivers include increasing demand for faster project turnaround, remote/hybrid work requiring better async documentation, and AI capabilities reaching sufficient quality for professional business writing. Competitors have begun exploring AI-assisted documentation, but none offer the integrated discovery-to-artifact workflow tailored for BA workflows.

Strategically, this product validates the hypothesis that AI can genuinely augment knowledge work (not just automate simple tasks), positions the organization for the AI-first documentation tools market, and provides learning for future AI-assisted professional tools. The product serves as a proving ground for human-AI collaboration patterns in enterprise settings.

## Business Objectives

### Primary Objective

**Reduce requirement documentation time by 50% while improving completeness by 30%.**

Business analysts currently spend 4-6 hours post-meeting converting notes to formal artifacts. This product should reduce that to 1-2 hours by generating first-draft artifacts during or immediately after discovery conversations. Completeness improvement measured by reduction in requirement gaps discovered during development (baseline to be established during pilot).

**Success Criteria:**
- Time from meeting end to artifact delivery reduced from average 6 hours to 3 hours (50% reduction)
- Requirement gaps discovered during development reduced from baseline by 30%
- BA satisfaction score of 4.0+ on 5-point scale for artifact quality
- 80% of generated artifacts require only minor edits before stakeholder review

### Secondary Objectives

1. **Enable consistent artifact quality regardless of BA experience level**
   - Junior BAs produce documentation meeting senior BA quality standards
   - Standardized artifact formats across all projects and teams
   - Success metric: Stakeholder quality ratings show no significant variance by BA experience (< 0.5 point difference)

2. **Support mobile-first in-meeting use**
   - BAs can use the tool during live customer meetings without disrupting conversation flow
   - Voice input enables hands-free capture when typing is impractical
   - Success metric: 70% of users report using mobile during at least one meeting per week

3. **Reduce context-switching between tools**
   - Single interface for document upload, conversation, artifact generation, and export
   - No need to copy-paste between tools
   - Success metric: 90% of BA workflow completed within single application

**Steps:**
1. BA opens project in BA Assistant before meeting, reviews uploaded context documents
2. BA starts new conversation thread and selects "Meeting Mode"
3. During meeting, BA types or speaks customer statements into conversation
4. AI asks clarifying questions, suggests edge cases, probes for missing information
5. BA relays AI questions to stakeholder and captures responses
6. AI periodically summarizes understanding for BA confirmation
7. When discovery complete, BA requests artifact generation: "Generate user stories for this feature"
8. AI generates structured user stories with acceptance criteria based on conversation
9. BA reviews generated artifacts, requests revisions if needed
10. BA exports artifacts to PDF/Word for stakeholder distribution
11. AI saves artifacts to thread for future reference

**Error Scenarios:**
- **Network loss during meeting:** Partial AI response preserved, BA can retry when connection restored
- **AI response takes too long:** Heartbeat keeps connection alive, progress indicator shows AI is thinking
- **Generated artifacts incomplete:** BA can request regeneration with additional guidance

### Flow 2: Post-Meeting Document Refinement

**User Persona:** Junior Business Analyst
**Business Goal:** Convert rough meeting notes into formal documentation with AI assistance
**User Goal:** Produce stakeholder-ready BRD from uploaded meeting notes

**Steps:**
1. BA creates new project and uploads meeting notes document
2. BA starts conversation and selects "Document Refinement Mode"
3. BA pastes or references the meeting notes
4. AI analyzes notes and identifies gaps requiring clarification
5. AI asks targeted questions to fill information gaps
6. BA provides additional context or marks items as "unknown - to be discovered"
7. BA requests BRD generation: "Create the BRD"
8. AI generates comprehensive BRD following standard template
9. BA reviews each section, requests specific revisions
10. BA exports final BRD in desired format
11. BA shares with senior BA for review

**Error Scenarios:**
- **Uploaded document too large:** System validates size before upload, provides clear error with resolution
- **Notes too vague for artifact generation:** AI flags specific gaps and prompts for clarification before generating
- **Generated BRD missing sections:** AI validates completeness before generation, prompts for required information

### Flow 3: Cross-Device Workflow (Desktop to Mobile to Desktop)

**User Persona:** Senior Business Analyst
**Business Goal:** Prepare on desktop, capture on mobile during meeting, finalize on desktop
**User Goal:** Seamless transition between devices without losing context

**Steps:**
1. Day before: BA opens BA Assistant on desktop, creates project, uploads context documents
2. Day before: BA reviews documents, prepares initial questions in notes
3. Meeting time: BA opens BA Assistant on mobile, navigates to same project
4. Mobile: BA creates new thread for this meeting's discovery
5. During meeting: BA captures key points using mobile interface
6. During meeting: AI provides real-time suggestions (visible only to BA)
7. After meeting: BA returns to desktop for intensive artifact work
8. Desktop: BA opens same thread, sees all mobile conversation
9. Desktop: BA requests artifact generation with full keyboard for detailed guidance
10. Desktop: BA refines and exports artifacts

**Error Scenarios:**
- **Mobile loses connection during meeting:** Logs queued locally, sync when connection restored
- **Desktop shows stale data:** Refresh pulls latest from server, no data loss
- **URL not preserved after auth:** Session storage preserves intended destination through OAuth flow

### Flow 4: Project-less Quick Chat

**User Persona:** Sales/Account Manager
**Business Goal:** Quickly capture customer requirements without full project setup
**User Goal:** Get AI assistance for requirement discovery in 2 minutes or less

**Steps:**
1. User opens BA Assistant and clicks "Start Conversation" on home screen
2. System creates project-less chat thread immediately
3. User types customer need: "Customer wants inventory tracking for their warehouse"
4. AI engages in discovery: asks clarifying questions, suggests considerations
5. User captures responses during or after customer call
6. When sufficient context gathered, user requests artifact: "Create user stories"
7. AI generates user stories for the captured requirements
8. User exports and shares with BA team for follow-up
9. Optionally: User associates chat with project later via "Add to Project"

**Error Scenarios:**
- **User wants to add to project but no projects exist:** Prompt to create project first
- **Chat accidentally started project-less when project intended:** "Add to Project" recovers the situation

## Business Processes

### Process 1: Requirements Discovery Meeting

- **Current State:** BA attends meeting with notepad/laptop, manually captures key points while facilitating discussion. After meeting, spends 2-4 hours transcribing notes, formatting into user stories, identifying gaps (often missing edge cases), and iterating with stakeholders on missed items. Total cycle: 1-2 days from meeting to deliverable.

- **Future State:** BA uses BA Assistant during meeting, with AI capturing and structuring information in real-time, prompting for edge cases and clarifications. AI generates draft artifacts immediately after meeting. BA reviews and refines for 30-60 minutes. Total cycle: Same day delivery.

- **Process Flow:**
  1. Pre-meeting: BA uploads any existing documents to project
  2. Meeting start: BA opens conversation in Meeting Mode
  3. During meeting: BA captures customer statements, AI structures and probes
  4. Meeting end: BA requests artifact generation
  5. Post-meeting (30 min): BA reviews and refines AI output
  6. Same day: BA shares artifacts with stakeholders

- **Stakeholders:** Business Analyst (primary user), Customer/Stakeholder (discovery source), Development Team (artifact consumer), Product Manager (oversight)

### Process 2: Junior BA Onboarding

- **Current State:** Junior BAs shadow senior BAs for 3-6 months before leading meetings independently. Documentation quality varies significantly; senior BA review catches issues but creates bottleneck. Time to independence: 6+ months.

- **Future State:** Junior BAs use BA Assistant from day one, with AI guiding discovery questions and ensuring artifact completeness. Senior BA reviews AI-generated output (faster than reviewing junior raw work). Time to independence: 2-3 months.

- **Process Flow:**
  1. Week 1: Junior BA shadows senior BA who demonstrates BA Assistant workflow
  2. Week 2-4: Junior BA leads simple discoveries with BA Assistant, senior reviews output
  3. Month 2-3: Junior BA handles medium complexity independently, senior spot-checks
  4. Month 3+: Junior BA fully independent, AI maintains quality floor

- **Stakeholders:** Junior BA (user), Senior BA (mentor/reviewer), HR/Training (onboarding owner)

### Process 3: Cross-Team Handoff

- **Current State:** When BA hands project to development, requirements live in various documents, emails, and meeting notes. Developers piece together context from multiple sources. Requirements gaps discovered during development require BA re-engagement.

- **Future State:** Complete conversation history, uploaded documents, and generated artifacts all accessible in single project. Developers can review discovery conversations to understand "why" behind requirements. Fewer gaps because AI prompted edge case discovery.

- **Process Flow:**
  1. BA completes discovery in BA Assistant with all artifacts generated
  2. BA exports summary artifacts and shares project access with tech lead
  3. Tech lead reviews artifacts and original conversations for context
  4. If questions arise, tech lead can see full discovery conversation (not just final artifact)
  5. Reduced back-and-forth because context is complete

- **Stakeholders:** Business Analyst (handoff source), Tech Lead (handoff recipient), Development Team (context consumers)

## Regulatory and Compliance Requirements

**Data Security:**
- All uploaded documents encrypted at rest using industry-standard encryption (Fernet symmetric encryption)
- All data transmission over HTTPS
- OAuth 2.0 authentication delegates identity security to Google/Microsoft
- No storage of user passwords

**Privacy Considerations:**
- User conversation data stored only for that user's access
- No sharing of user data across accounts
- Users can delete projects/threads which cascade-deletes all associated data
- Logs sanitized to exclude sensitive content (API keys, auth tokens)

**Enterprise Requirements:**
- SSO integration with corporate identity providers (Google Workspace, Microsoft 365)
- Role-based access control (admin vs. standard user)
- Audit log capability for compliance review (admin-accessible log download)

**AI-Specific Considerations:**
- AI API calls made to third-party providers (Anthropic, Google, DeepSeek)
- Customer data sent to AI providers for processing — users should be informed
- No training of AI models on user data (per standard API terms)

---

## Assumptions and Constraints

**Assumptions:**
- Users have stable internet connectivity for real-time AI interaction
- Users have Google Workspace or Microsoft 365 work accounts for authentication
- AI API quality is sufficient for professional business documentation
- Target users are comfortable with conversational interfaces (chat-style input)
- Meeting context can be effectively captured via typed/voice input (no need for automated meeting transcription)
- Text document context is sufficient (no need for image, diagram, or complex document parsing)

**Constraints:**
- **Solo Developer Capacity:** 20-30 hours/week development time, must prioritize ruthlessly
- **AI API Costs:** Budget of ~$100/month for AI APIs during pilot; features must be cost-conscious
- **Text-Only Documents:** PDF and Word parsing deferred to future version to reduce complexity
- **Single-User per Account:** No multi-user collaboration or project sharing in v1.x
- **PaaS Deployment:** Limited to Railway/Render capabilities; no custom infrastructure
- **No Offline Mode:** Requires network connection; offline capability deferred to v2.0+
