# Milestone v1.6: UX Quick Wins

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-30
**Phases:** 11-14
**Total Plans:** 5

## Overview

This milestone delivered four friction-reduction features for the conversation workflow: copy AI responses, retry failed messages, display auth provider, and rename threads. All features use existing Flutter SDK capabilities with zero new dependencies. Frontend-only features executed first (Copy, Retry, Auth), followed by the full-stack feature (Thread Rename).

## Phases

### Phase 11: Copy AI Response

**Goal:** Users can copy AI-generated content to clipboard with one tap.
**Depends on:** None
**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 11-01: Add copy button to assistant messages with clipboard integration

**Details:**
- Copy icon visible on all assistant messages (not user messages)
- Synchronous clipboard call for Safari compatibility
- Snackbar feedback: "Copied to clipboard" / "Failed to copy"
- Cross-platform support (web, Android, iOS)

---

### Phase 12: Retry Failed Message

**Goal:** Users can recover from AI request failures without retyping.
**Depends on:** None (parallel with Phase 11)
**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 12-01: Add retry state to provider and retry button to error banner

**Details:**
- Error banner shows "Dismiss | Retry" actions when AI request fails
- Retry resends the last user message without retyping
- Failed message state tracked in ConversationProvider
- Works for both network errors and API errors
- Smart duplicate prevention on retry

---

### Phase 13: Auth Provider Display

**Goal:** Users can identify which OAuth provider they authenticated with.
**Depends on:** None (parallel with Phases 11-12)
**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 13-01: Add authProvider field to provider and display in settings profile

**Details:**
- Auth provider indicator shown in Settings profile section
- Display format: "Signed in with Google" or "Signed in with Microsoft"
- Provider value extracted from backend /auth/me response
- Clears on logout, updates on re-login

---

### Phase 14: Thread Rename

**Goal:** Users can rename conversation threads after creation.
**Depends on:** Phases 11-13 (execute last as full-stack feature)
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 14-01: Backend PATCH endpoint for thread rename
- [x] 14-02: Frontend service, provider, dialog, and UI integration

**Details:**
- Edit icon in ConversationScreen AppBar opens rename dialog
- "Rename" option in Thread List PopupMenu
- Dialog pre-fills current thread title
- Backend PATCH endpoint with ownership validation
- Returns 404 for non-owner (security: no existence leak)

---

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:** None

**Key Decisions:**
- Synchronous clipboard for Safari compatibility (no async/await before setData)
- PATCH for thread rename (not PUT) - semantically correct for partial update
- Return 404 for non-owner threads - security: don't leak existence
- Preserve messageCount when updating thread in provider (API doesn't return it)

**Issues Resolved:**
- Safari clipboard compatibility via synchronous call pattern
- Duplicate message prevention on retry via smart state tracking

**Issues Deferred:**
- Partial streaming response preservation (deferred to v2)
- Regenerate option for alternative AI response (deferred to v2)
- Long-press copy menu (one-tap sufficient)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
None - clean implementation with zero new dependencies
