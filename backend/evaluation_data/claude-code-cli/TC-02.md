## Document Metadata

- **Version:** 1.0 Draft
- **Author:** Generated by BA Assistant
- **Date:** 2026-02-15
- **Status:** Draft — Pending Review
- **Project:** Expense Report Submission and Approval System
- **Scope:** End-to-end expense submission, multi-level approval workflow, finance integration, and payment processing for a mid-size consulting firm

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This Business Requirements Document outlines the requirements for an Expense Report Submission and Approval System for a mid-size consulting firm with 150 employees across 3 offices. The system will replace the current manual Excel-based process with an automated solution that enables employees to submit expense reports with receipt photos, routes submissions through a multi-tiered approval workflow based on dollar thresholds, and integrates with QuickBooks for finance processing. The primary business objective is to reduce expense processing time, eliminate lost submissions, ensure policy compliance, and accelerate reimbursement cycles from weeks to 5 business days.

The system will serve three primary user groups: consultants who submit expenses, managers who review and approve submissions, and finance staff who process payments and maintain financial records. Success will be measured by reduction in processing time, elimination of lost submissions, improved compliance with receipt requirements, and achievement of the 5-business-day reimbursement target.

---

## 2. Business Context

**Current Challenges:**
The organization currently manages expense reporting through a manual Excel spreadsheet process where consultants email forms to managers for approval. This approach has created significant operational friction:

- **Lost submissions:** Email-based tracking results in frequent loss of expense submissions, requiring resubmission and delaying reimbursement
- **Lack of visibility:** Managers have no centralized view of pending approvals or team spending patterns
- **Slow processing:** Manual handoffs between employee → manager → finance create delays, with reimbursement cycles extending weeks beyond policy targets
- **Compliance gaps:** No systematic enforcement of receipt requirements or detection of duplicate submissions
- **Manual data entry:** Finance staff must manually transcribe approved expenses into QuickBooks, introducing errors and consuming significant time

**Market Drivers:**
Frequent business travel by consulting staff makes timely, accurate expense reimbursement a key employee satisfaction factor. Competitive labor market conditions require the firm to deliver seamless administrative experiences. Additionally, financial audit requirements mandate clear expense approval trails and duplicate detection controls.

**Strategic Alignment:**
This system aligns with the organization's broader operational excellence initiative to reduce administrative overhead, improve employee experience, and strengthen financial controls. Automation of expense workflows will free finance and management capacity for higher-value activities while ensuring compliance with company policies and audit requirements.

Employees SHALL be able to submit expense reports including expense category, date, merchant name, amount, description, and receipt photo/document attachment. The system SHALL enforce mandatory receipt attachment for all submissions.

**Business Rationale:**  
Core functionality required to replace current Excel-based process. Mandatory receipt attachment enforces company policy: "no receipt means no reimbursement."

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. System SHALL provide expense submission form accessible via web portal and mobile application
2. System SHALL require the following fields: expense category (dropdown), expense date (date picker), merchant name (text input), amount (currency input with 2 decimal precision), description (text area up to 500 characters)

**Complexity:** L (Large)

---

#### FR-P0-02: Tiered Approval Workflow Based on Dollar Thresholds

**Description:**  
System SHALL automatically route expense submissions through approval workflow based on dollar amount: expenses under $50 SHALL be auto-approved, expenses $50-$500 SHALL require direct manager approval, and expenses over $500 SHALL require both direct manager approval and Finance Director approval.

**Business Rationale:**  
Implements company approval policy to balance control (high-value expenses require oversight) with efficiency (low-value expenses auto-approved to reduce bottlenecks).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. System SHALL evaluate expense amount against approval thresholds within 5 seconds of submission
2. System SHALL auto-approve expenses under $50.00 with no manual intervention, updating status to "Approved" and queuing for payment processing
3. System SHALL route expenses between $50.00 and $500.00 to submitting employee's direct manager, updating status to "Pending Manager Approval"

5. After manager approves expenses over $500.00, system SHALL route to Finance Director for second-level approval, updating status to "Pending Finance Director Approval"
6. System SHALL send email notification to assigned approver(s) within 60 seconds of expense entering their approval queue
7. System SHALL record approval audit trail: approver name, approval timestamp, approval decision (approved/rejected), optional approver comment

**Error/Exception Scenarios:**
1. **Direct manager not assigned:** If employee's direct manager is not designated in system, expense submission SHALL fail with error message: "Cannot route expense for approval - no direct manager assigned to your account. Please contact HR to resolve." Finance team SHALL receive alert notification to manually assign manager and reprocess submission.
2. **Finance Director role vacant or unavailable:** If system cannot identify Finance Director for dual approval (role unassigned or marked inactive), expense SHALL remain in "Pending Finance Director Approval" status and system SHALL send alert to finance team: "Dual approval required for Expense #[ID] but Finance Director role is not assigned. Please designate approver manually."

**Complexity:** M (Medium)

---

#### FR-P0-03: Expense Category Classification

**Description:**  
System SHALL provide predefined expense categories for consistent classification: Meals, Transportation, Lodging, Client Entertainment, Office Supplies, and Miscellaneous. Employees SHALL select one category per expense submission.

**Business Rationale:**  
Standardized categories enable accurate budget tracking, financial reporting, and QuickBooks integration. Aligns with company chart of accounts structure.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. System SHALL display expense category dropdown with exactly six options: "Meals", "Transportation", "Lodging", "Client Entertainment", "Office Supplies", "Miscellaneous"

3. System SHALL store selected category with each expense submission for reporting and export purposes
4. System SHALL map each category to corresponding QuickBooks expense account code during export (mapping configuration maintained by finance administrator)

**Error/Exception Scenarios:**
1. **Category not selected:** If employee attempts to submit expense without selecting category (if dropdown allows blank state), system SHALL display error message: "Expense category is required. Please select the category that best matches your expense." Submission SHALL be blocked until category is selected.
2. **QuickBooks mapping missing:** If finance administrator has not configured QuickBooks account mapping for a category, export process SHALL flag unmapped expenses and send alert to finance team: "Cannot export Expense #[ID] - category '[Category Name]' has no QuickBooks account mapping. Please configure mapping in system settings."

**Complexity:** S (Small)

---

#### FR-P0-04: Manager Approval Dashboard with Pending Expenses View

**Description:**  
Managers SHALL have access to dashboard displaying all pending expense approvals assigned to them, with ability to review expense details, view receipt images, and approve or reject submissions with optional comments.

**Business Rationale:**  
Centralized approval interface replaces email-based workflow, enabling managers to efficiently process approvals and maintain visibility into team spending without searching inboxes.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. System SHALL display manager dashboard accessible within 2 clicks of login (e.g., main navigation → "Approvals" or dashboard landing page with "Pending Approvals" widget)

7. System SHALL remove approved or rejected expense from manager's pending approval queue immediately after action is taken

**Error/Exception Scenarios:**
1. **Rejection without reason:** If manager attempts to reject expense without entering rejection reason (or reason is fewer than 10 characters), system SHALL display error message: "Rejection reason is required and must be at least 10 characters. Please provide clear feedback to help employee resubmit correctly." Rejection action SHALL be blocked until valid reason is provided.
2. **Concurrent approval conflict:** If two managers both have approval access to same expense (e.g., backup approver scenario) and both attempt to approve simultaneously, system SHALL accept first approval action received and display message to second manager: "This expense was already approved by [Manager Name] at [timestamp]. No further action required." Duplicate approval SHALL be prevented.

**Complexity:** M (Medium)

---

#### FR-P0-05: Email Notifications at All Workflow Stages

**Description:**  
System SHALL send automated email notifications to employees, managers, and finance staff at key workflow events: submission confirmation, approval required, approval granted, rejection with reason, and payment processed.

**Business Rationale:**  
Proactive notifications eliminate need for employees to check system status manually, reduce follow-up inquiries, and ensure timely manager action on pending approvals.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. System SHALL send submission confirmation email to employee within 60 seconds of successful expense submission, including expense ID, amount, category, and expected reimbursement timeline

2. **Employee email address not on file:** If employee's email address is missing or invalid in system, submission SHALL still succeed but system SHALL send alert to HR and finance teams: "Expense #[ID] submitted by [Employee Name] but no valid email address on file - employee will not receive notifications. Please update employee record."

**Complexity:** M (Medium)

---

#### FR-P0-06: QuickBooks Export for Approved Expenses

**Description:**  
Finance staff SHALL be able to export approved expenses to QuickBooks in IIF (Intuit Interchange Format) file format, including all necessary transaction details: employee name, expense category mapped to QuickBooks account, amount, expense date, approval date, and receipt reference.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. System SHALL provide "Export to QuickBooks" function accessible to finance staff from payment processing dashboard
2. System SHALL generate IIF file containing all approved expenses with status "Pending Export" (expenses approved since last export)
3. IIF file SHALL include required fields for QuickBooks import: transaction date (expense date), account (mapped from expense category), amount, memo (employee name + expense description), document number (expense ID)

**Complexity:** M (Medium)

---

#### FR-P0-07: 5-Business-Day Reimbursement Processing Requirement

**Description:**  
System SHALL support reimbursement processing workflow enabling finance staff to process approved expenses via direct deposit within 5 business days of final approval. System SHALL track approval date and payment date to measure compliance with reimbursement timeline target.

**Business Rationale:**  
Timely reimbursement is critical for employee satisfaction and retention, particularly for traveling consultants who incur frequent out-of-pocket expenses. Current manual process often exceeds 2-3 weeks; 5-business-day target represents significant improvement.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. System SHALL record final approval timestamp for each expense (date/time when last required approval is granted)
2. System SHALL calculate reimbursement due date as final approval date + 5 business days (excluding weekends and company holidays)
3. System SHALL display reimbursement due date on finance payment processing dashboard for each approved expense pending payment
4. System SHALL flag expenses where current date exceeds reimbursement due date (overdue for payment) in finance dashboard with visual indicator (e.g., red highlight)

Please process payment batch to meet reimbursement commitment."
2. **Holiday calendar not maintained:** If company holiday calendar is not configured in system, business day calculation MAY be inaccurate. System SHALL send reminder to administrator quarterly: "Company holiday calendar for [upcoming quarter] is not configured. Please update holiday calendar to ensure accurate reimbursement due date calculations."

**Complexity:** M (Medium)

---

#### FR-P0-08: Rejected Expense Resubmission Capability

**Description:**  
When manager rejects expense with reason provided, employee SHALL be able to view rejection reason and resubmit corrected expense. Resubmitted expense SHALL follow standard approval workflow with visibility into previous rejection context.

**Business Rationale:**  
Policy compliance often requires corrections (e.g., missing receipt, unclear documentation). Resubmission workflow enables employees to fix issues without creating entirely new submission, maintaining audit trail of rejection/correction cycle.

7. Manager reviewing resubmitted expense SHALL see rejection history: original rejection reason, original approver, resubmission comment from employee

**Error/Exception Scenarios:**
1. **Employee resubmits without corrections:** If employee resubmits expense with identical details and same receipt file (no corrections made), system SHALL allow submission but send notification to manager: "Resubmitted expense from [Employee Name] appears identical to rejected submission. Previous rejection reason: [reason]. Please verify corrections were made before approving."
2. **Multiple resubmissions of same expense:** If employee resubmits same expense more than 3 times, system SHALL send alert to finance team and employee's manager: "Expense originally submitted as #[ID] has been rejected and resubmitted 3+ times. Please contact employee to resolve underlying issue." Normal workflow continues, but stakeholders are notified of repeated rejection cycle.

### Priority: P1 (Should-Have)

#### FR-P1-01: Backup Approver Automatic Routing

**Description:**  
When employee's direct manager is marked as unavailable (vacation, out of office), system SHALL automatically route expense approvals to designated backup approver maintained in HR system. System SHALL notify backup approver of delegation context.

**Business Rationale:**  
Prevents reimbursement delays when managers are on vacation or unavailable. Ensures continuous approval workflow without manual reassignment.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. System SHALL integrate with HR system (or maintain internal backup approver designations) to retrieve backup approver assignment for each manager
2. Before routing expense to manager for approval, system SHALL check manager availability status (available/unavailable flag and unavailable date range)
3. If direct manager is marked unavailable and current date falls within unavailable date range, system SHALL route expense to designated backup approver instead
4. System SHALL send email notification to backup approver within 60 seconds of routing, including context: "You are designated backup approver for [Manager Name] during [date range]. Approval required for [Employee Name]: [amount] [category] expense."
5. System SHALL send informational notification to primary manager upon return from unavailability: "FYI: [X] expenses from your team were approved by [Backup Approver Name] during your absence ([date range]). Review approval history in dashboard."
6. System SHALL record backup approver delegation in expense audit trail: "Approved by [Backup Name] (backup for [Manager Name] during unavailability period [dates])"

**Error/Exception Scenarios:**
1. **Backup approver not designated:** If direct manager is marked unavailable but no backup approver is designated in HR system, expense SHALL remain in "Pending Approval" status and system SHALL send alert to finance team and HR: "Expense #[ID] cannot be routed for approval - manager [Name] is unavailable until [date] but no backup approver is designated. Please assign backup approver to unblock approval workflow."
2. **Backup approver also unavailable:** If both direct manager and designated backup approver are marked unavailable simultaneously, system SHALL send escalation alert to finance director and HR: "Expense #[ID] cannot be routed - both manager [Name] and backup approver [Name] are unavailable. Please manually assign approver or contact employee to defer submission until manager returns."

**Complexity:** M (Medium)

---

#### FR-P1-02: Duplicate Submission Detection

**Description:**  
System SHALL detect potential duplicate expense submissions (same employee, same amount, same date, same merchant, or matching receipt image) and flag for finance review before payment processing. Detected duplicates SHALL be blocked from automatic approval.

**Business Rationale:**  
Prevents fraudulent or accidental duplicate expense payments. Protects company from financial loss due to duplicate reimbursements.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. When employee submits new expense, system SHALL compare submission against all existing expenses from same employee submitted within previous 90 days
2. System SHALL flag expense as "Potential Duplicate" if ANY of the following match existing expense: (a) identical amount, merchant, and expense date, OR (b) receipt image file hash matches previous receipt, OR (c) receipt image visual similarity score exceeds 90% (if image matching capability available)
3. Flagged duplicate expense SHALL NOT proceed through automatic approval workflow — status SHALL be set to "Flagged for Review - Potential Duplicate"
4. System SHALL send alert notification to finance staff within 60 seconds of duplicate detection: "Potential duplicate expense detected - Employee [Name] submitted [amount] [category] expense on [date] matching previous submission Expense #[ID] from [date]."
5. Finance staff SHALL be able to review flagged expense and comparison to suspected duplicate, then take action: (a) "Confirm Duplicate - Reject", or (b) "Not Duplicate - Approve for Processing"
6. If finance staff confirms duplicate, system SHALL reject expense and send notification to employee: "Expense #[ID] rejected as duplicate of Expense #[original ID] already submitted on [date]. If this is a different expense, please contact finance to resolve."
7. If finance staff confirms not duplicate, system SHALL release expense to normal approval workflow based on amount threshold

**Error/Exception Scenarios:**
1. **False positive duplicate detection:** If system incorrectly flags legitimate expense as duplicate (e.g., employee incurs two identical meal expenses on same day at same merchant), finance staff review process SHALL allow override. System SHALL log override action: "Flagged duplicate Expense #[ID] confirmed as legitimate by [Finance Staff Name] on [date] - reason: [staff comment]."
2. **Receipt image matching unavailable:** If receipt image hashing or visual similarity detection is not available (technical limitation), system SHALL rely only on metadata matching (amount, merchant, date). System SHALL log limitation in duplicate detection report: "Duplicate detection is metadata-based only - receipt image matching not available."

**Complexity:** L (Large)

---

#### FR-P1-03: Manager Dashboard with Monthly Team Spending View

**Description:**  
Manager dashboard SHALL display monthly spending summary by team member, showing total expenses submitted, total approved, total pending, and spending trends over time. Dashboard SHALL enable managers to identify unusual spending patterns and stay within budget.

**Business Rationale:**  
Provides managers with proactive visibility into team spending for budget management and identification of policy violations or unusual patterns. Supports financial oversight responsibility.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Manager dashboard SHALL include "Team Spending" section displaying current month summary: total expenses submitted by team, total approved, total pending approval, total rejected
2. Dashboard SHALL display spending by team member table with columns: Employee Name, Expenses Submitted (count), Total Amount Submitted, Amount Approved, Amount Pending, Amount Rejected
3. Manager SHALL be able to filter spending view by date range (current month, previous month, last 3 months, last 6 months, custom date range)
4. Manager SHALL be able to click any team member row to view detailed expense history: list of all expenses with submission date, category, amount, status
5. Dashboard SHALL refresh spending data within 5 minutes of any expense submission, approval, or rejection action
6. Dashboard SHALL display visual spending trend chart showing month-over-month team spending for last 6 months

**Error/Exception Scenarios:**
1. **Data refresh delay exceeds 5 minutes:** If spending data is not refreshed within 5 minutes due to system load or technical issue, dashboard SHALL display last refresh timestamp and manual refresh button: "Data last updated: [timestamp]. Click here to refresh now."
2. **Manager has no direct reports:** If manager role is assigned to user who has no direct reports in HR system, dashboard SHALL display informational message: "You have no direct reports assigned in the system. Team spending data is not available. If this is incorrect, please contact HR."

**Complexity:** M (Medium)

---

### Priority: P2 (Nice-to-Have)

#### FR-P2-01: Mobile App for On-the-Go Expense Submission

**Description:**  
System SHALL provide native mobile application (iOS and Android) enabling employees to submit expenses, capture receipt photos using device camera, and check submission status while traveling.

**Business Rationale:**  
Traveling consultants incur expenses on-the-go and benefit from immediate mobile submission capability. Mobile-first experience reduces delay between expense incurred and submission, improving employee experience and reducing forgotten receipts.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. System SHALL provide native mobile application for iOS (minimum version: iOS 14) and Android (minimum version: Android 10)
2. Mobile app SHALL provide all core submission functionality: category selection, date picker, merchant input, amount input, description input, receipt photo capture or upload
3. Mobile app SHALL integrate with device camera to capture receipt photos directly within app (no need to exit to camera app)
4. Mobile app SHALL allow employees to view submission history, check expense status, and receive push notifications for approvals, rejections, and payments
5. Mobile app SHALL sync data in real-time with web portal — expenses submitted via mobile SHALL appear in web portal immediately and vice versa
6. Mobile app SHALL support offline submission drafting — if device is offline, employee SHALL be able to enter expense details and capture receipt photo, then submit automatically when connectivity is restored

**Error/Exception Scenarios:**
1. **Camera permission denied:** If employee denies camera permission to mobile app, receipt capture feature SHALL be disabled and app SHALL display message: "Camera access is required to capture receipt photos. Please enable camera permission in device settings to use this feature. You can still upload receipt photos from device photo library."
2. **Offline submission sync failure:** If expense drafted offline cannot sync when connectivity is restored (e.g., server unavailable, authentication expired), app SHALL display error message: "Cannot submit expense - connection to server failed. Your expense draft is saved locally and will automatically submit when connection is restored. You can also submit manually by clicking 'Retry'."

**Complexity:** XL (Extra Large)

---

#### FR-P2-02: Direct Deposit Integration with Payroll System

**Description:**  
System SHALL integrate with existing payroll system to automate direct deposit payments for approved expense reimbursements, eliminating manual payment file preparation by finance staff.

**Business Rationale:**  
Full automation of payment processing reduces finance manual effort and ensures consistent, reliable payment delivery. Tighter integration with payroll system improves accuracy and reduces reimbursement cycle time.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. System SHALL integrate with payroll system API (or batch file transfer if API not available) to transmit approved expense payment instructions
2. Finance staff SHALL be able to initiate payment batch from expense system with single "Process Payments" action
3. System SHALL generate payment file containing: employee ID (payroll system identifier), payment amount, payment date, expense IDs included in payment
4. System SHALL transmit payment file to payroll system via secure API call or SFTP file transfer
5. Payroll system SHALL process direct deposit payments according to standard payroll schedule (e.g., next business day for payments submitted by 3pm)
6. System SHALL receive payment confirmation from payroll system (via API callback or batch confirmation file) and update expense status to "Paid" with payment date recorded
7. System SHALL send payment confirmation email to employees after receiving payroll system confirmation

**Error/Exception Scenarios:**
1. **Payroll system integration failure:** If payment file transmission to payroll system fails (e.g., API unavailable, authentication error, SFTP connection failure), system SHALL retry transmission up to 3 times over 2-hour period. If still unsuccessful, system SHALL send alert to finance director: "Payment batch submission to payroll system failed after 3 attempts. Please manually submit payment file or contact IT to resolve integration issue."
2. **Employee not found in payroll system:** If approved expense is for employee whose employee ID is not found in payroll system (e.g., new hire not yet onboarded in payroll, contractor without direct deposit setup), payment SHALL be excluded from batch and system SHALL send alert to finance staff: "Cannot process payment for Expense #[ID] - employee [Name] not found in payroll system. Please verify employee record and process payment manually."

**Complexity:** L (Large)

## 7. Business Processes

### Process 1: Expense Submission to Reimbursement (End-to-End)

**Current State:**  
Employee incurs business expense, saves paper receipt, fills out Excel expense report template at end of month, attaches scanned receipts to email, sends to manager. Manager reviews email, approves or rejects via reply email, forwards approved expenses to finance. Finance manually transcribes data from Excel to QuickBooks, prepares payment batch, submits to payroll. Entire process takes 2-4 weeks on average, with frequent lost submissions requiring resubmission.

**Future State:**  
Employee incurs business expense, immediately submits via mobile app with receipt photo while traveling or same day. System auto-approves if under $50, routes to manager if $50-$500, routes to manager + Finance Director if over $500. Manager reviews and approves in dashboard. Finance exports approved expenses to QuickBooks with single click, processes direct deposit payment batch. Approved expenses reimbursed within 5 business days. Zero lost submissions due to system tracking and audit trail.

**Process Flow:**

1. **Expense Incurred:** Employee incurs business expense (meal, travel, lodging, etc.) and receives receipt from merchant
2. **Expense Submission:** Employee logs into system (mobile app or web portal), enters expense details, captures/uploads receipt photo, selects category, submits
3. **Submission Validation:** System validates required fields, enforces receipt attachment, generates expense ID, sends confirmation email to employee
4. **Approval Routing:** System evaluates amount against thresholds:
   - Under $50: Auto-approve, queue for payment
   - $50-$500: Route to manager for approval
   - Over $500: Route to manager for first approval, then Finance Director for second approval
5. **Manager Review:** Manager receives email notification, logs into dashboard, reviews expense details and receipt, approves or rejects with optional comment
6. **Approval Notification:** System sends approval confirmation email to employee (or rejection email with reason if rejected)
7. **Payment Processing:** Finance staff exports approved expenses to QuickBooks weekly, processes direct deposit payment batch via payroll system
8. **Payment Confirmation:** System sends payment confirmation email to employee when direct deposit is processed
9. **Reimbursement Complete:** Employee receives reimbursement via direct deposit within 5 business days of final approval

**Stakeholders:**
- **Employees (submitters):** Initiate process by submitting expenses
- **Managers (approvers):** Review and approve/reject moderate and high-value expenses
- **Finance Director (secondary approver):** Review and approve high-value expenses over $500
- **Finance Staff (processors):** Export to QuickBooks, process payment batches
- **Payroll System (automated):** Execute direct deposit payments

---

### Process 2: Exception Handling - Rejected Expense Resubmission

**Current State:**  
Manager rejects expense via email reply with brief reason. Employee must search email history to find rejection, understand issue, create entirely new Excel form, reattach receipts, resend email. No tracking of rejection history or resubmission link to original submission.

**Future State:**  
Manager rejects expense in system with required detailed rejection reason. Employee receives email notification with rejection reason, clicks link to view rejected expense, selects "Resubmit", corrects issues, uploads new/corrected receipt if needed, adds resubmission comment, resubmits. System maintains link between original rejection and resubmission for audit trail. Manager sees rejection history when reviewing resubmitted expense.

**Process Flow:**

1. **Rejection:** Manager reviews expense, identifies issue (e.g., blurry receipt, missing merchant name, incorrect category), clicks "Reject", enters detailed rejection reason, confirms rejection
2. **Employee Notification:** System sends rejection email to employee within 60 seconds, including rejection reason, approver name, and link to view rejected expense in system
3. **Employee Reviews Rejection:** Employee logs into system, views rejected expense details and manager's rejection reason
4. **Resubmission:** Employee clicks "Resubmit Expense", system prepopulates form with original details, employee corrects issues (uploads clearer receipt, updates merchant name, etc.), adds resubmission comment explaining corrections, submits
5. **Resubmission Routing:** System routes resubmitted expense through standard approval workflow (manager approval based on amount)
6. **Manager Review with Context:** Manager receives approval request, sees rejection history including original rejection reason and employee's resubmission comment, reviews corrected submission, approves or rejects again
7. **Resolution:** If approved, proceeds to payment workflow. If rejected again, cycle repeats (system alerts finance after 3+ rejections for manual intervention)

**Stakeholders:**
- **Employees (submitters):** Correct and resubmit rejected expenses
- **Managers (approvers):** Provide clear rejection feedback, review resubmissions with context
- **Finance Staff (escalation):** Intervene if rejection cycle repeats excessively

---

## 10. Regulatory and Compliance Requirements

**IRS Substantiation Requirements:**  
Expense reimbursements must comply with IRS accountable plan rules requiring adequate substantiation of business expenses. Each expense submission must include:
- Receipt or other documentary evidence showing amount, date, place, and business purpose
- Reimbursement must be for deductible business expenses only
- System must maintain records for minimum 7 years for audit purposes

**System Compliance:**  
System SHALL enforce mandatory receipt attachment for all submissions, capture expense date and merchant name (place), require employee-provided business purpose description, and maintain permanent audit trail of all submissions, approvals, and payments with 7-year retention minimum.

**Data Privacy and Security:**  
Employee expense data includes personally identifiable information (PII) such as employee names, bank account details for direct deposit, and potentially sensitive business information (client names in expense descriptions). System must comply with:
- Access controls limiting expense data visibility to authorized users only (employee sees own expenses, manager sees direct report expenses, finance sees all expenses)
- Encrypted storage of sensitive financial data (bank account details, receipt images)
- Secure transmission of data between system and integrations (QuickBooks, payroll system) using HTTPS/TLS
- Audit logging of all data access and modifications for security review

**Financial Controls and Audit Trail:**  
System must support financial audit requirements:
- Complete audit trail of all approval actions (who approved, when, optional comment)
- Immutable approval history (no deletion or modification of approval records)
- Duplicate detection controls to prevent fraudulent reimbursement
- Segregation of duties: employees cannot approve own expenses, managers cannot modify approval thresholds
- Reporting capability to generate audit reports showing approval compliance, policy adherence, and payment history

**No Industry-Specific Compliance Identified:**  
Organization is not subject to HIPAA, GDPR, SOX, or other industry-specific regulatory frameworks based on information provided. Standard corporate financial controls and IRS compliance are primary requirements.

---

## 11. Assumptions and Constraints

### Assumptions

1. **HR System Integration Available:** Assumes organization has HR system (or can maintain internal database) containing employee-manager relationships and backup approver designations. If HR system integration is not feasible, system will require manual maintenance of organizational hierarchy.

2. **QuickBooks Desktop Version:** Assumes organization uses QuickBooks Desktop (not QuickBooks Online) based on IIF file format requirement. If QuickBooks Online is used, integration approach will need adjustment (API-based integration instead of file export).

3. **Direct Deposit Infrastructure Exists:** Assumes organization has existing payroll system with direct deposit capability. Expense reimbursement payments will leverage existing direct deposit infrastructure.

4. **Email Delivery Reliability:** Assumes organization has reliable email system for notification delivery. System notifications depend on email delivery for user awareness of submission confirmations, approvals, rejections, and payments.

5. **Receipt Photo Quality Responsibility:** Assumes employees are responsible for capturing legible receipt photos. System will not provide automatic image enhancement or OCR validation of receipt content beyond file format validation.

6. **Single Currency (USD):** Assumes all expenses are submitted in U.S. Dollars. Multi-currency support and foreign exchange conversion are not included in scope.

7. **Manager Availability Flagging:** Assumes managers (or HR) will proactively update availability status in system when going on vacation or PTO to enable backup approver routing. Automatic calendar integration is not in scope.

8. **Approval Threshold Configuration:** Assumes approval thresholds ($50, $500) are configured during system implementation and rarely change. Dynamic threshold adjustment by finance administrators is not required in initial release.

### Constraints

1. **No Automatic Receipt OCR/Data Extraction:** System will NOT automatically extract expense data (amount, date, merchant) from receipt images using OCR. Employees must manually enter expense details. Receipt photos serve as supporting documentation only.

2. **No Real-Time QuickBooks Integration:** QuickBooks integration is batch-based (file export/import), not real-time API integration. Finance staff must manually download IIF file from expense system and import into QuickBooks.

3. **No Automated Direct Deposit Processing:** Direct deposit payment processing requires manual finance staff action to initiate payment batch. Fully automated payment processing (system automatically triggers direct deposit without human review) is not in scope for P0 requirements.

4. **Mobile App is P2 (Nice-to-Have):** Native mobile application is lower priority. Web portal must provide mobile-responsive design for initial launch; native iOS/Android apps are future enhancement.

5. **Single Approver Per Tier:** Approval workflow supports one manager approver and one Finance Director approver. Multiple parallel approvers (e.g., both manager A and manager B must approve) are not supported.

6. **No Mileage or Per Diem Calculation:** System supports receipt-based expense submission only. Automated mileage calculation (based on trip distance) or per diem allowances (based on travel days) are not in scope.

7. **No Budget Enforcement:** System provides spending visibility to managers but does NOT enforce budget limits (e.g., blocking expense submission if team exceeds monthly budget). Budget management remains manual manager responsibility.

8. **Company Holiday Calendar Requires Manual Maintenance:** Business day calculation for 5-day reimbursement timeline requires manually maintained company holiday calendar. Automatic holiday calendar sync (e.g., from Outlook, Google Calendar) is not in scope.

---

## 12. Risks and Mitigation Strategies

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|------------|---------------------|
| **QuickBooks Integration Complexity** | High (Finance cannot export expenses to QuickBooks, requiring continued manual entry) | Medium | Conduct technical discovery with QuickBooks consultant during architecture phase to validate IIF file format compatibility. Build and test QuickBooks import with sample data before full implementation. Identify QuickBooks version and edition early to confirm integration approach feasibility. |
| **User Adoption Resistance from Employees** | Medium (Employees continue using Excel/email, limiting system value) | Medium | Engage traveling consultant representatives in system design review to ensure mobile-first experience meets needs. Conduct user training sessions emphasizing time savings and faster reimbursement benefits. Provide side-by-side Excel vs. system comparison showing efficiency gains. Hard cutoff date for Excel submissions to force adoption. |
| **Manager Availability Status Not Maintained** | Medium (Backup approver routing fails, causing approval delays) | High | Integrate with HR system to automatically flag manager PTO if feasible. If not feasible, implement email reminder to managers 1 week before scheduled PTO: "You are scheduled for PTO [dates]. Please designate backup approver or confirm existing backup." Provide finance staff override capability to manually assign backup approver if manager fails to update status. |
| **5-Business-Day Reimbursement Target Unachievable** | High (Primary business objective not met, employee satisfaction impact) | Low | Design approval workflow to minimize handoff delays (automated routing, email notifications). Establish finance payment batch schedule (e.g., weekly every Friday) to ensure predictable processing. Monitor reimbursement timeline compliance report weekly during first 3 months post-launch to identify bottlenecks early. Escalate overdue payments to Finance Director for immediate action. |
| **Duplicate Detection False Positives** | Low (Legitimate expenses flagged as duplicates, causing employee frustration) | Medium | Implement finance staff review process for all flagged duplicates before automatic rejection. Provide clear duplicate comparison view showing why system flagged expense (matching amount, date, merchant, receipt). Allow finance override with logged justification. Monitor false positive rate monthly and tune detection algorithm sensitivity if needed. |
| **Receipt Photo Quality Issues** | Medium (Blurry or illegible receipts causing rejection and resubmission cycles) | High | Provide in-app receipt photo guidance (e.g., "Ensure merchant name, date, and amount are clearly visible"). Implement client-side image quality check (e.g., resolution, brightness) with warning if photo appears low quality before submission. Include receipt photo best practices in employee training. Manager rejection feedback loop (detailed rejection reason) educates employees on quality requirements. |
| **Payroll System Integration Delays** | Low (Direct deposit automation delayed, requiring manual payment file preparation) | Medium | Treat payroll integration as P2 (Nice-to-Have) enhancement, not P0 blocker. Finance staff can manually prepare payment files for payroll system using system-generated payment report if integration is delayed. Prioritize QuickBooks integration (P0) over payroll integration (P2) to deliver core finance efficiency gains first. |
| **Scope Creep - Feature Requests Beyond Core Requirements** | Medium (Project timeline and budget overruns) | High | Maintain strict priority classification (P0/P1/P2) and defer all P2 features to post-launch roadmap. Establish change control process requiring executive sponsor approval for any P0/P1 scope additions. Communicate to stakeholders that P0 delivers core workflow replacement; P1/P2 features will be phased in over 6-12 months post-launch. |
| **Data Migration from Excel Spreadsheets** | Low (Historical expense data not available in new system) | Low | System launch is clean cutoff - no historical data migration required. All expenses submitted after launch date go through new system. Historical expenses remain in Excel archive for audit purposes (7-year retention). Finance maintains Excel archive separately; no system import needed. |

## 13. Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Next 2 Weeks)

1. **Technical Architecture Review:** Engage technical team (architects, developers) to review BRD and design system architecture, including:
   - Technology stack selection (web framework, database, mobile app platform if P2 pursued)
   - QuickBooks integration approach validation (IIF file format compatibility with organization's QuickBooks version)
   - HR system integration feasibility assessment (API availability, data mapping)
   - Receipt image storage strategy (cloud storage, database, file size limits)

2. **Customer Sign-Off:** Present BRD to customer stakeholders (Finance Director, HR representative, sample managers, sample consultants) for review and approval. Collect feedback on any missing requirements, incorrect assumptions, or priority adjustments. Finalize BRD with customer approval signature.

3. **Implementation Estimation:** Technical team provides effort estimates for P0, P1, and P2 requirements. Sales team develops project proposal including timeline, resource plan, and pricing.

### Planning Phase (Weeks 3-4)

4. **Detailed Design and Prototyping:** Technical team creates detailed design documents (data model, API specifications, approval workflow state machine, UI wireframes). Build clickable prototype of core workflows (expense submission, manager approval dashboard) for customer validation.

5. **Integration Discovery:** Conduct technical discovery sessions with QuickBooks consultant and HR system administrator to finalize integration specifications, data mapping, and authentication approach.

6. **Project Kickoff:** Formal project kickoff meeting with customer and implementation team. Establish communication cadence (weekly status meetings), define success criteria, confirm timeline and milestones.

### Development and Deployment (Weeks 5-20, estimated)

7. **Iterative Development:** Implement P0 requirements in priority order: expense submission, approval workflow, manager dashboard, QuickBooks export, notifications. Conduct bi-weekly demo sessions with customer stakeholders to gather feedback and adjust.

8. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Customer stakeholders test system in staging environment using real-world scenarios. Validate all P0 acceptance criteria met. Finance staff tests QuickBooks import with sample data.

9. **Training and Change Management:** Conduct training sessions for employees (expense submission), managers (approval dashboard), and finance staff (payment processing, QuickBooks export). Develop quick-start guides and video tutorials.

10. **Production Launch:** Deploy system to production environment. Communicate launch date and Excel submission cutoff to all employees. Provide support hotline for first 2 weeks post-launch to address user questions.

11. **Post-Launch Monitoring:** Track success metrics weekly for first 3 months (reimbursement cycle time, receipt compliance, finance time savings). Conduct employee satisfaction survey at 30 days and 90 days post-launch. Iterate based on feedback and metrics.
