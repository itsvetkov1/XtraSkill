### Deferred to v2.0 (2)

| Requirement | Reason | Impact |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| POLISH-03 | Thread model lacks lastMessagePreview field; requires backend API change | LOW - users see date+count metadata instead |
| CONV-UI-03 | Thread list mode indicator requires backend API change | LOW - mode visible when opening thread |

These deferrals were documented in 10-05-SUMMARY.md and align with REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table.

## Cross-Phase Integration

All cross-phase dependencies verified as connected:

### Phase Dependencies

| Dependency | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Phase 8 → Phase 6 (ThemeProvider) | WIRED |
| Phase 8 → Phase 7 (Navigation destination) | WIRED |
| Phase 9 → Phase 7 (Post-delete routing) | WIRED |
| Phase 10 → Phase 9 (Empty states after delete) | WIRED |

### API Integration

| Endpoint | Consumer | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|
| GET /auth/me (display_name) | AuthProvider, SettingsScreen | CONNECTED |
| GET /auth/usage | SettingsScreen | CONNECTED |
| DELETE /projects/{id} | ProjectProvider | CONNECTED |
| DELETE /threads/{id} | ThreadProvider | CONNECTED |
| DELETE /documents/{id} | DocumentProvider | CONNECTED |
| DELETE /messages/{id} | ConversationProvider | CONNECTED |

## E2E Flow Verification

All 5 critical user flows verified complete:

| Flow | Steps | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| New User Onboarding | Home → Browse Projects → Empty State → Create Project | COMPLETE |
| Theme Persistence | Settings → Toggle Dark → Restart → Theme Persists | COMPLETE |
| Deletion with Undo | Delete Project → See Empty State → Undo → Project Restored | COMPLETE |
| Navigation | Home → Project → Thread → Breadcrumb Back → Sidebar Consistent | COMPLETE |
| Profile Display | OAuth Login → Settings → Display Name + Email Shown | COMPLETE |

## Tech Debt Summary

### Deferred Items (2)

**Phase 10 - Polish & Empty States:**

1. **POLISH-03: Thread preview text**
   - Status: Deferred to v2.0
   - Reason: Thread model lacks `lastMessagePreview` field
   - Current behavior: Shows date and message count
   - Required for fix:
     - Backend: Add `lastMessagePreview` to thread list API
     - Model: Add field to Thread model
     - UI: Display preview in thread_list_screen.dart

2. **CONV-UI-03: Thread mode indicator**
   - Status: Deferred to v2.0
   - Reason: LOW priority, requires backend tracking of mode per thread
   - Current behavior: Mode visible when thread is opened

### Anti-Patterns (0)

No TODO/FIXME markers, placeholder code, or stub implementations found across Phase 6-10 artifacts.

### Human Verification Items

Each phase has documented human verification items for visual/interactive behaviors:

- Phase 6: Dark mode startup flash, default theme, toggle responsiveness
- Phase 7: Responsive breakpoints, sidebar persistence, breadcrumb clicks
- Phase 8: OAuth display name, logout flow, token usage display
- Phase 9: Full delete flow, undo window, error rollback
- Phase 10: Visual empty states, date thresholds, mode selector interaction

## Milestone Definition of Done

From ROADMAP.md:
> Transform the MVP into an executive-demo-ready application through comprehensive navigation improvements, professional empty states, deletion capabilities, and visual consistency enhancements.

### Verification Against Definition

| Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Navigation improvements | ACHIEVED | NAV-01 through NAV-05 all satisfied |
| Professional empty states | ACHIEVED | ONBOARD-01 through ONBOARD-05 all satisfied |
| Deletion capabilities | ACHIEVED | DEL-01 through DEL-07 all satisfied |
| Visual consistency | MOSTLY ACHIEVED | POLISH-01, 02, 04, 05 satisfied; POLISH-03 deferred |

**Conclusion:** Milestone definition of done is achieved with minor visual consistency deferral.

## Recommendation

**PROCEED TO COMPLETE MILESTONE**

Beta v1.5 successfully transforms the MVP into an executive-demo-ready application:

1. **94% requirement coverage** with only LOW priority items deferred
2. **100% phase completion** with all verifications passed
3. **100% integration** with no orphaned exports or missing connections
4. **100% E2E flows** working end-to-end
5. **Zero anti-patterns** or blocking technical debt

The two deferred items (thread preview text, thread mode indicator) are explicitly LOW priority and documented for v2.0. They do not impact executive demos or core user workflows.
