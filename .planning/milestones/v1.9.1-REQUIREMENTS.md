## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| E2E/integration tests | Already have some; focus on unit tests |
| UI snapshot tests | Low ROI for current stage |
| Performance/load testing | Different milestone |
| 100% coverage | Diminishing returns; target meaningful coverage |
| Mutation testing | Advanced technique, defer to future |
