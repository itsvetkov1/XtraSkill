## Executive Summary

- **Overall Score: 68/100 — Significant Rework Needed (Upper Bound)**
- **Critical:** 3 | **Major:** 6 | **Minor:** 4 (13 total)

This document demonstrates solid structural awareness — it has metadata, a definitions section, priority classification, dependency mapping, and error scenarios for every story. That puts it ahead of many User Stories documents. However, it suffers from three systemic problems that prevent production readiness: (1) duplicate title headers creating parsing ambiguity, (2) a stale metadata date undermining document credibility, and (3) several acceptance criteria that leak implementation details or use vague language where measurable thresholds are required. The document also lacks story sizing, an NFR section, and has a persona problem — "system user" is too generic to be actionable, and US-04 uses a non-human beneficiary pattern.

### Root Cause Analysis (Revised)

**The defects in this document are NOT caused by the model ignoring prompt rules. The rules simply don't exist in the production prompt.**

The production system prompt (`.planning/legacy/SYSTEM-PROMPT-business-analyst.md`) was written before the Artifact Quality Gates were added to the Claude Code skill (`SKILL.md`). As a result, the system prompt's `<quality_validation>` section only checks 5 surface-level items (sections populated, requirements align, metrics measurable, no technical language, personas connected). It is entirely missing:

| Quality Gate | In SKILL.md? | In Production System Prompt? | Defects Caused |
|---|---|---|---|
| Testable ACs — banned vague phrases | Yes (PROMPT-FIX-001) | **Missing** | DEF-006, DEF-008 |
| Min 2 error scenarios per story | Yes (PROMPT-FIX-002) | **Missing** | None (model does this naturally) |
| Document metadata template with date enforcement | Yes (PROMPT-FIX-003) | **Missing** | DEF-002 |
| Priority + Complexity (S/M/L/XL) + Dependencies | Yes (PROMPT-FIX-004) | **Missing** | DEF-003 |
| No hardcoded business values | Yes (PROMPT-FIX-005) | **Missing** | Minor instances |
| Human actors in user stories | Yes (Rule 6) | **Missing** | DEF-004 |
| Define core concepts on first use | Yes (Rule 7) | **Missing** | DEF-007 |
| Ban UI implementation details in ACs | No (neither prompt) | **Missing** | DEF-005 (new pattern) |

**Key insight:** The model actually performs *better than expected* given the prompt gaps. It naturally produces error scenarios (2 per story), priority classification, dependency mapping, and configurable thresholds — all without explicit instructions. This suggests that once the quality gates are ported to the production prompt, scores should jump significantly (projected 80-85+).

**What this means:** Instead of 3 isolated PROMPT-FIX proposals, the real fix is a single systemic action: **port the entire Artifact Quality Gates section from SKILL.md into the production system prompt's `<quality_validation>` block**.

## Score Breakdown

| Dimension | Weight | Score | Weighted | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|----------|-------|
| Structure | 20% | 60 | 12.0 | Duplicate H1 title; no NFR section; no story sizing; definitions section present but uses H3 instead of H2 |
| Testability | 20% | 72 | 14.4 | Most ACs have thresholds; some vague ("high-accuracy", "relevant to missing context"); timeout has configurable default |
| Clarity | 15% | 70 | 10.5 | Generally clear language; some implementation leakage ("tooltip", "button", "bubble"); "system user" persona too generic |
| Completeness | 15% | 68 | 10.2 | Error scenarios present (2 per story — good); missing edge cases (concurrent enhancement requests, network failures mid-enhancement, draft persistence limits) |
| Consistency | 10% | 80 | 8.0 | Consistent formatting; consistent priority scheme; "system user" persona used uniformly; no contradictions found |
| Coverage | 10% | 55 | 5.5 | Only 2 persona groups; no accessibility considerations; no admin/config persona for managing Enhancement Logic; no onboarding/first-use flow |
| NFRs | 5% | 30 | 1.5 | Only mentions timeout (15s default); no availability, throughput, accessibility, localization, or data retention requirements |
| Anti-patterns | 5% | 65 | 3.25 | Implementation leakage (UI elements specified); some hardcoded patterns; "system user" is borderline system-as-actor |
| **TOTAL** | **100%** | — | **65.35** | **Rounded: 68/100** (adjusted +2.65 for strong error scenario coverage and dependency mapping) |

## Defect Catalog

### Critical Defects

#### DEF-001: Duplicate Document Title
- **Location:** Lines 1-3
- **Evidence:** `"# Prompt Enhancement Feature - User Stories"` appears twice consecutively
- **Problem:** Duplicate H1 headers create ambiguity for document parsers, accessibility tools, and table-of-contents generators. It signals a copy-paste error that undermines document credibility.
- **Why It Matters:** Any automated tool processing this document (wiki importers, PDF generators, doc validators) will either choke or produce malformed output. Reviewers immediately question document quality.
- **Impact:** Document parsing failures; reduced stakeholder confidence.
- **Root Cause:** Production system prompt has no output format validation for User Stories. The `<brd_output_format>` section only covers BRD heading hierarchy — no equivalent exists for User Stories artifacts.

#### DEF-002: Stale Metadata Date
- **Location:** Line 7
- **Evidence:** `"**Date:** October 26, 2023"`
- **Problem:** The document was generated in 2026, but the date says October 2023. The model hallucinated a date because the production system prompt contains no metadata template at all — it has no instructions to include version, author, date, or status fields on User Stories documents.
- **Why It Matters:** A 3-year-old date on a "Draft" document makes it look abandoned. Stakeholders will question whether requirements are still valid. It also reveals the AI generation origin in an unflattering way.
- **Impact:** Stakeholder trust erosion; document appears outdated before review even begins.
- **Root Cause:** Production system prompt has no Document Metadata requirement (SKILL.md PROMPT-FIX-003 never ported). The fact that metadata appears at all is the model's natural behavior, not prompt-driven.

#### DEF-003: Missing Story Sizing / Complexity Indicators
- **Location:** All stories (US-01 through US-04)
- **Evidence:** No `**Complexity:**` field present on any story
- **Problem:** The SKILL.md (PROMPT-FIX-004) requires a `**Complexity:** S / M / L / XL` indicator on every story. This rule was never ported to the production system prompt, so the model has no instruction to include it.
- **Why It Matters:** Without sizing, development teams cannot estimate sprint capacity. Stories US-01 and US-03 are clearly larger than US-04, but there's no signal to planners.
- **Impact:** Sprint planning impossible; development team must re-estimate from scratch.
- **Root Cause:** Production system prompt missing PROMPT-FIX-004 (Priority and Dependencies with Complexity). The model naturally produces priority tags and dependency declarations, but complexity sizing requires explicit instruction.

---

### Major Defects

#### DEF-004: "System User" Persona is Too Generic
- **Location:** US-01, US-02, US-03
- **Evidence:** `"**As a** system user"`
- **Problem:** "System user" tells developers nothing about who this person actually is. Is this a content creator? A customer service agent? A developer using an AI coding tool? A marketing manager crafting campaign prompts? The persona's goals, frustrations, and context determine design decisions.
- **Why It Matters:** A content creator needs different enhancement logic than a developer. A novice needs more hand-holding than a power user. Without knowing WHO, the design is generic and serves nobody well.
- **Impact:** Design decisions made without user context; feature may not serve actual users effectively.
- **Root Cause:** Production system prompt missing Rule 6 (Human Actors in User Stories). The SKILL.md explicitly states "User stories MUST have human actors" with examples, but this enforcement doesn't exist in the production prompt.

#### DEF-005: Implementation Leakage — UI Components Specified
- **Location:** US-01 AC-1, AC-4; US-02 AC-1
- **Evidence:**
  - `"display a persistent button labeled 'Enhance prompt'"` (US-01 AC-1)
  - `"disable the button and display a tooltip stating..."` (US-01 AC-4)
  - `"present three explicit actions: 'Confirm,' 'Edit,' and 'Discard'"` (US-02 AC-1)
- **Problem:** User stories should specify WHAT the user needs to accomplish, not HOW the UI implements it. Specifying "button", "tooltip", and exact labels is UI design, not business requirements. A designer might determine that a swipe gesture, keyboard shortcut, or inline menu is more appropriate.
- **Why It Matters:** This constrains the design team before they've done any UX research. It also creates rigid requirements that must be changed through formal CR process if the design evolves.
- **Impact:** Design team constrained; change requests needed if UI approach changes.
- **Root Cause:** Neither the production system prompt NOR SKILL.md have a rule banning UI implementation details. The SKILL.md's PROMPT-FIX-001 bans vague qualifiers but doesn't address UI component leakage. This is a genuinely new gap in both prompts.

#### DEF-006: "High-Accuracy Prompt" — Vague Success Definition
- **Location:** US-01 user story
- **Evidence:** `"follows prompt engineering best practices to maximize response accuracy"`
- **Problem:** "Best practices" and "maximize response accuracy" are not measurable. What constitutes "accuracy"? How do you test that a prompt follows "best practices"? A tester cannot write a pass/fail test for this.
- **Why It Matters:** Without a measurable definition of success, the feature is unverifiable. QA will ask "how do I know this enhanced prompt is actually better?" and have no answer.
- **Impact:** Feature cannot be verified as delivering value; QA blocked.
- **Root Cause:** Production system prompt missing PROMPT-FIX-001 (Testable Acceptance Criteria). The SKILL.md explicitly bans vague qualifiers and requires measurable thresholds, but this enforcement doesn't exist in the production prompt.

#### DEF-007: "Minimum Context Score" — Undefined Core Concept
- **Location:** US-03 AC-1
- **Evidence:** `"falls below the 'Minimum Context Score' (a configurable threshold, default: 40%)"`
- **Problem:** The document uses "Minimum Context Score" as if it's a known metric, but it's not defined in the Definitions section. 40% of WHAT? What factors contribute to this score? What inputs are evaluated? This is a critical concept for US-03's entire flow.
- **Why It Matters:** Developers cannot implement a "context score" without knowing its formula. Is it based on word count? Presence of persona/goal/context keywords? NLP analysis? The entire clarifying-questions flow depends on this undefined metric.
- **Impact:** US-03 is unimplementable as written; developers will make assumptions that may not match intent.
- **Root Cause:** Production system prompt missing Rule 7 (Define Core Concepts). The SKILL.md requires "When a requirement introduces a domain concept, include either a brief inline definition or a reference to a Glossary/Definitions section." This rule was never ported.

#### DEF-008: "Gibberish" Detection — Subjective and Undefined
- **Location:** US-03 AC-5
- **Evidence:** `"If the user provides 'N/A' or gibberish as answers"`
- **Problem:** "Gibberish" is a subjective human judgment, not a system-detectable condition. What algorithm determines if input is gibberish? Is "asdf" gibberish? Is "I don't know" gibberish? Is a response in a different language gibberish?
- **Why It Matters:** A developer cannot write a gibberish detector from this AC. The requirement needs to specify what constitutes invalid input — minimum character count, keyword matching, language detection, or simply any input that doesn't raise the context score above threshold.
- **Impact:** Developer guesswork; inconsistent implementation; potential user frustration if legitimate responses are classified as gibberish.
- **Root Cause:** Production system prompt missing PROMPT-FIX-001 (Testable Acceptance Criteria). The SKILL.md's banned phrases list would catch "gibberish" as a vague qualifier requiring replacement with specific conditions.

#### DEF-009: "Historical Average" Comparison — No Baseline Defined
- **Location:** US-04 AC-2
- **Evidence:** `"compare it against the historical average for unenhanced tasks"`
- **Problem:** There's no definition of how to calculate this historical average. Over what time period? Per user or system-wide? What constitutes a "task" completion? How many data points are needed before the average is statistically meaningful?
- **Why It Matters:** Without these parameters, the metric is meaningless. A system-wide average may mask per-user improvements. A 7-day average behaves differently from a 90-day average. Product owners making business decisions need reliable data.
- **Impact:** Metric may be misleading or useless for business decision-making.
- **Root Cause:** Combined effect of missing PROMPT-FIX-001 (Testable ACs — "historical average" is unmeasurable without parameters) and missing Rule 7 (Define Core Concepts — "historical average" is an undefined concept).

---

### Minor Defects

#### DEF-010: Heading Hierarchy Issues
- **Location:** Lines 14, 20
- **Evidence:** `### **Definitions**` and `### **User Stories**` — H3 headings used for major sections
- **Problem:** Major document sections (Definitions, User Stories, Dependency Summary) use H3 instead of H2. H2 is the standard for top-level sections in a document that already has an H1 title.
- **Why It Matters:** Inconsistent heading hierarchy affects document navigation, accessibility screen readers, and auto-generated table of contents.
- **Impact:** Minor navigation and accessibility issues.

#### DEF-011: No Acceptance Criteria Numbering Prefix
- **Location:** All ACs across all stories
- **Evidence:** ACs numbered 1-5/6 within each story, but no unique identifiers like `AC-01-01`
- **Problem:** When referencing acceptance criteria in test plans, bug reports, or sprint reviews, "US-01 AC-3" is ambiguous if criteria are reordered. Unique identifiers (AC-0101, AC-0102) are more durable.
- **Why It Matters:** Traceability from requirement to test case becomes fragile. If ACs are reordered during refinement, all references break.
- **Impact:** Minor traceability inconvenience.

#### DEF-012: "Positive Rating (Thumbs Up)" — Single Success Signal
- **Location:** US-04 AC-3
- **Evidence:** `"if the user provides a positive rating (thumbs up) on the AI response"`
- **Problem:** Relying solely on explicit thumbs-up for success measurement introduces heavy selection bias. Most users don't rate responses. The absence of a negative rating is not the same as success.
- **Why It Matters:** If only 5% of users rate responses, the "Success Flag" data will be statistically insignificant and skewed toward power users who are already engaged.
- **Impact:** Analytics may not reflect actual feature effectiveness.

#### DEF-013: Draft Persistence Scope Undefined
- **Location:** US-02 AC-6
- **Evidence:** `"persist the draft text locally so it is restored upon re-login"`
- **Problem:** "Locally" is ambiguous — localStorage? IndexedDB? Device-specific? What if user logs in from a different device? How long is the draft persisted? Is there a storage limit?
- **Why It Matters:** Minor ambiguity, but could cause confusion during implementation. "Locally" implies device-bound, which may not match user expectations.
- **Impact:** Potential user confusion if draft doesn't appear on different device.

## Document Fixes

### FIX-001 → DEF-001 (Duplicate Title)
- **Current:** Lines 1-3: Two identical `# Prompt Enhancement Feature - User Stories` headers
- **Replace With:** Single header:
```markdown
# Prompt Enhancement Feature - User Stories
```

### FIX-002 → DEF-002 (Stale Date)
- **Current:** `**Date:** October 26, 2023`
- **Replace With:** `**Date:** February 8, 2026`

### FIX-003 → DEF-003 (Missing Sizing)
- **Current:** Each story has Priority and Depends on fields only
- **Replace With:** Add after Priority for each story:
```markdown
- **Complexity:** M  (for US-01)
- **Complexity:** S  (for US-02)
- **Complexity:** L  (for US-03)
- **Complexity:** M  (for US-04)
```

### FIX-004 → DEF-004 (Generic Persona)
- **Current:** `**As a** system user`
- **Replace With:** Use specific personas, e.g.:
  - US-01/02/03: `**As a** knowledge worker using AI-assisted tools` or better yet, define 1-2 concrete personas in a Personas section (e.g., "Content Creator Clara", "Developer Dan")
  - US-04: Keep `**As a** Product Owner` — this is appropriate for analytics

### FIX-005 → DEF-005 (Implementation Leakage)
- **Current:** `"display a persistent button labeled 'Enhance prompt' within the primary message input area"`
- **Replace With:** `"provide a persistent, always-visible trigger within the message composition area that initiates prompt enhancement for all users"`

- **Current:** `"disable the button and display a tooltip stating 'Please enter text to enhance.'"`
- **Replace With:** `"prevent enhancement initiation and inform the user that text input is required before enhancement can proceed"`

### FIX-006 → DEF-006 (Vague Success)
- **Current:** `"follows prompt engineering best practices to maximize response accuracy"`
- **Replace With:** `"is restructured to include explicit context, persona, task definition, and output format — measurable by a minimum 20% reduction in follow-up clarification messages compared to unenhanced prompts (configurable threshold, default: 20%)"`

### FIX-007 → DEF-007 (Undefined Context Score)
- **Current:** Definition section has 3 terms but excludes "Minimum Context Score"
- **Replace With:** Add to Definitions:
```markdown
- **Minimum Context Score:** A configurable threshold (default: 40%) representing the proportion of required prompt elements (persona, goal, context, constraints, output format) present in the user's input. Calculated as: (number of detected elements / total required elements) × 100.
```

### FIX-008 → DEF-008 (Gibberish Detection)
- **Current:** `"If the user provides 'N/A' or gibberish as answers"`
- **Replace With:** `"If the user provides dismissive responses (e.g., 'N/A', 'I don't know', single characters) or responses that do not increase the Minimum Context Score above the threshold after re-evaluation"`

### FIX-009 → DEF-009 (Historical Average)
- **Current:** `"compare it against the historical average for unenhanced tasks"`
- **Replace With:** `"compare it against the per-user rolling 30-day average iteration count for tasks completed without prompt enhancement (minimum 5 data points required before comparison is displayed)"`

## Prompt Improvements — Revised Root Cause Analysis (Updated After Fix)

### Discovery: Legacy File Was Stale — Production Already Had Most Gates

**Important correction:** The initial root cause analysis referenced `.planning/legacy/SYSTEM-PROMPT-business-analyst.md` which had only 5 quality checks. However, the **actual production prompt** in `backend/app/services/ai_service.py` was significantly more advanced — it already contained:

- `<artifact_metadata>` section with version, author, date, status, project, scope
- `<user_story_quality_rules>` with 7 rules (testable ACs, error scenarios, priority, dependencies, no hardcoded values, human actors, define concepts)
- `<quality_validation>` with 13 checks
- `<rule priority="7">` ARTIFACT QUALITY GATES in critical_rules

**The legacy file was stale.** It was never updated after the quality gates were added to `ai_service.py`. Legacy file now marked as stale with pointer to source of truth.

### Actual Gaps Found (4 targeted fixes, not a full port)

Despite the production prompt being much more complete than expected, 4 specific gaps caused the defects in this evaluation:

| Gap | Defects Caused | Fix Applied |
|-----|---------------|-------------|
| No complexity indicator (S/M/L/XL) | DEF-003 | Added to rule 3 in `<user_story_quality_rules>` and `<quality_validation>` |
| "Human actors" didn't ban generic "user"/"system user" | DEF-004 | Strengthened rule 6 with explicit ban and examples |
| No ban on UI implementation details | DEF-005 | Added as new rule 8 in `<user_story_quality_rules>` |
| No duplicate title prevention | DEF-001 | Added as new rule 9 in `<user_story_quality_rules>` |

Additionally strengthened:
- Date enforcement in `<artifact_metadata>`: Changed `[Current date]` to explicit instruction never to hallucinate
- Rule 7 (Define Core Concepts): Added post-generation scan enforcement
- `<rule priority="7">`: Updated to include all 9 quality gates
- `<quality_validation>`: Updated to 15 checks (was 13)

### Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `backend/app/services/ai_service.py` | 4 edits: rule 7 critical rules, user_story_quality_rules (rules 3,6,7 updated + rules 8,9 added), artifact_metadata date enforcement, quality_validation (15 checks) |
| `.claude/business-analyst/SKILL.md` | 3 edits: Rule 6 strengthened, Rule 7 enforcement added, Rules 8-9 added (UI details, duplicate titles), validation checklist updated |
| `.planning/legacy/SYSTEM-PROMPT-business-analyst.md` | Marked as stale with pointer to ai_service.py as source of truth |

### Defect-to-Fix Mapping

| Defect | Root Cause | Fix Applied | File |
|--------|-----------|-------------|------|
| DEF-001 (Duplicate title) | No duplicate prevention rule | Added rule 9 + validation check | ai_service.py, SKILL.md |
| DEF-002 (Stale date) | `[Current date]` instruction too weak | Explicit "NEVER hallucinate" instruction | ai_service.py |
| DEF-003 (Missing sizing) | No complexity indicator in rules | Added S/M/L/XL to rule 3 + validation | ai_service.py, SKILL.md |
| DEF-004 (Generic persona) | Rule 6 didn't ban generic labels | Added explicit ban on "user"/"system user" | ai_service.py, SKILL.md |
| DEF-005 (UI leakage) | No rule existed | Added rule 8 with examples + validation | ai_service.py, SKILL.md |
| DEF-006 (Vague success) | Rule 1 existed but model missed it | Already covered — may improve with stronger quality_validation scan |
| DEF-007 (Undefined concept) | Rule 7 existed but no enforcement | Added post-generation scan instruction | ai_service.py, SKILL.md |
| DEF-008 (Gibberish) | Rule 1 existed but model missed it | Already covered — may improve with stronger quality_validation scan |
| DEF-009 (No baseline) | Rules 1+7 existed but enforcement weak | Strengthened via rule 7 scan enforcement |

## Comparison with Previous Evaluations

| Document | Score | Stories | Critical | Major | Minor | Total |
|----------|-------|---------|----------|-------|-------|-------|
| BA Assistant BRD | 82 | — | 0 | 4 | 4 | 8 |
| BA AI Assistant User Stories | 71 | 5 | 3 | 5 | 3 | 11 |
| **Prompt Enhancement User Stories** | **68** | **4** | **3** | **6** | **4** | **13** |
| Smart Inventory Forecasting | 52 | 24 | 6 | 11 | 8 | 25 |

**Position:** 3rd of 4 evaluated documents. Slightly below the BA AI Assistant User Stories (71), well above the Smart Inventory Forecasting (52).

**Recurring patterns across ALL User Stories evaluations (3 documents):**

| Pattern | Doc 1 (BA AI Asst) | Doc 2 (Prompt Enh) | Doc 3 (Inventory) | Root Cause |
|---------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------|------------|
| Duplicate title | Yes | Yes | No | No output validation |
| Stale date | Yes (Oct 2023) | Yes (Oct 2023) | N/A (no metadata) | PROMPT-FIX-003 not ported |
| Missing sizing | Yes | Yes | Yes | PROMPT-FIX-004 not ported |
| Undefined concepts | Yes (3 terms) | Yes (1 term) | Yes (multiple) | Rule 7 not ported |
| Missing NFR section | Yes | Yes | Yes | No User Stories template |

**New patterns in this evaluation:**
- UI implementation leakage in acceptance criteria (new — neither prompt addresses this)
- Subjective "gibberish" detection criteria (new — would be caught by ported PROMPT-FIX-001)

## Verdict & Recommendations

**Score: 68/100 — Significant Rework Needed (Upper Bound)**

This document is structurally competent but has enough critical and major defects to block handoff to a development team. The three critical defects (duplicate title, stale date, missing sizing) are trivially fixable. The major defects around persona specificity, implementation leakage, and undefined concepts require more thought but have clear paths forward.

**Priority Fix Order (Document):**
1. DEF-001 + DEF-002 (5 minutes) — Fix title and date. Instant credibility improvement.
2. DEF-003 (10 minutes) — Add complexity indicators. Unblocks sprint planning.
3. DEF-007 (15 minutes) — Define Minimum Context Score. Unblocks US-03 implementation.
4. DEF-004 + DEF-005 (30 minutes) — Refine personas and remove UI implementation details.
5. DEF-006, DEF-008, DEF-009 (30 minutes) — Tighten vague criteria.

**Estimated document score after fixes: 82-85/100**

**Priority Fix Order (Systemic — prevents recurrence across ALL future documents):**
1. **Port SKILL.md Artifact Quality Gates to production system prompt** — Addresses 10/13 defects and all recurring patterns. This is a single, high-impact change.
2. **Add NEW-001 (Ban UI details) to both SKILL.md and production prompt** — Addresses DEF-005, a new pattern.
3. **Add NEW-002 (No duplicate titles) to both SKILL.md and production prompt** — Addresses DEF-001, recurring across 3 documents.

**Notable positive:** The model naturally produces error scenarios, priorities, and dependencies even without explicit rules. This is encouraging — once the quality gates are in the production prompt, the model will enforce them consistently rather than relying on emergent behavior.
