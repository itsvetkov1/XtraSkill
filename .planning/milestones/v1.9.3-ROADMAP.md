# Milestone v1.9.3: Document & Navigation Polish

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-04
**Phases:** 37-39
**Total Plans:** 3

## Overview

v1.9.3 improves document workflow with upload preview and download capability, plus completes navigation context with enhanced breadcrumb trails. Three phases deliver independent, verifiable capabilities: download functionality (copy existing pattern), preview dialog (isolated UI), and breadcrumb enhancement (router changes).

## Phases

### Phase 37: Document Download

**Goal:** Users can download documents from the application to their device.

**Dependencies:** None (builds on existing file_saver pattern from artifact export)

**Requirements:** DOWNLOAD-01, DOWNLOAD-02, DOWNLOAD-03, DOWNLOAD-04, DOWNLOAD-05

**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 37-01-PLAN.md - Add download to viewer and list screens

**Success Criteria:**

1. User clicks download icon in Document Viewer AppBar and file downloads with original filename
2. User right-clicks document in list, selects Download, and file downloads with original filename
3. Success snackbar shows "Downloaded {filename}" after download completes
4. Download works on Chrome (web), Android emulator, and iOS simulator

**Research Notes:**
- Copy pattern from artifact_service.dart (file_saver already proven)
- Avoid dart:html (deprecated) - use file_saver package
- Lowest risk phase - single file touched for viewer download

### Phase 38: Document Preview

**Goal:** Users can review document content before uploading to confirm correct file selection.

**Dependencies:** None (isolated UI change, no backend work)

**Requirements:** DOC-01, DOC-02, DOC-03, DOC-04, DOC-05, DOC-06

**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 38-01-PLAN.md - Create preview dialog and integrate into upload flow

**Success Criteria:**

1. After selecting file, preview dialog appears showing filename and human-readable size (KB/MB)
2. Preview dialog shows first 20 lines of content in monospace font matching Document Viewer
3. User clicks Cancel to close dialog and clear selection (ready to pick different file)
4. User clicks Upload to proceed with upload (same behavior as before, but after confirmation)

**Research Notes:**
- Use PlatformFile.bytes and size (already available from file_picker)
- Wrap UTF-8 decode in try-catch with allowMalformed: true
- Create new DocumentPreviewDialog widget
- Capture provider reference before async gap

### Phase 39: Breadcrumb Navigation

**Goal:** Users see full navigation context including thread and document names in breadcrumbs.

**Dependencies:** Phase 37 (Document Viewer route change benefits from existing download button)

**Requirements:** NAV-01, NAV-02, NAV-03, NAV-04, NAV-05, NAV-06

**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 39-01-PLAN.md - Add document route, extend breadcrumbs, update navigation

**Success Criteria:**

1. Thread screen shows breadcrumb: Projects > {Project Name} > Threads > {Thread Title}
2. Project-less thread shows breadcrumb: Chats > {Thread Title}
3. Document Viewer shows breadcrumb: Projects > {Project Name} > Documents > {Document Name}
4. Each breadcrumb segment is clickable and navigates to that location
5. Document Viewer has proper URL route (/projects/:id/documents/:docId) enabling deep links

**Research Notes:**
- NAV-06 requires changing Document Viewer from Navigator.push to GoRouter route
- Add /projects/:id/documents/:docId route to main.dart
- Continue using GoRouterState.of(context) for breadcrumb state
- Highest coordination phase - touches router + multiple screens
- Test browser back button behavior after router changes

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:** None

**Key Decisions:**
- Screen-level download (no service): Simple 10-line operation; service would be over-engineering
- Fetch content first for list download: Documents in list don't have content loaded
- Static show() method for preview dialog: Consistent with ModeChangeDialog pattern
- First 20 lines with truncation indicator: Prevents UI lag on large files
- Nested document route under project: /projects/:id/documents/:docId enables breadcrumbs
- context.push for document navigation: Preserves browser history; back button returns to project
- Intermediate segments link to project: "Threads" and "Documents" link to project detail

**Issues Resolved:**
- None - clean execution across all phases

**Issues Deferred:**
- None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None identified
