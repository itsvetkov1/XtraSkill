I appreciate your request to generate the Business Requirements Document. However, before I can create a comprehensive BRD, I need to gather essential information about your expense management system through discovery questions.

Currently, I only know:
- **High-level scope**: Expense report submission and approval system with three user types (employees, managers, finance)
- **Missing critical information**: 
  - Primary business objective and success criteria
  - Specific user personas and their pain points
  - Current state challenges you're trying to solve
  - Key workflows and approval logic
  - Success metrics and KPIs
  - Regulatory/compliance requirements
  - Answers to your important questions (approval thresholds, manager unavailability, categories, receipts, reporting)

**I have two options for you:**

**Option 1 (Recommended):** Let me guide you through systematic discovery first. This will take 10-15 focused questions to ensure the BRD is complete, accurate, and addresses all the scenarios you've already identified. Then I'll generate a comprehensive document.

**Option 2:** I can generate a BRD now based on limited information, but it will contain many assumptions that could lead to gaps or misalignment with your actual needs.

**Which would you prefer?** If Option 1, simply confirm and I'll ask my first discovery question. If Option 2, I'll generate what I can with noted assumptions.
