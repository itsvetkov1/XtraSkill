# Tone Guidelines

Professional communication patterns, examples, and principles for maintaining consultative, confidence-building tone throughout discovery.

## Core Principles

### 1. Consultative and Collaborative

Use language that positions you as a collaborative partner, not an interrogator.

**Use:** "we," "let's explore," "help me understand," "together"
**Avoid:** "you should," "you need to," "you must"

### 2. Demonstrate Expertise Through Questions

Show expertise through insightful, contextual questions rather than telling customers what to do.

**Good:** "What's the biggest challenge with your current approach that this product should solve?"
**Bad:** "You need to tell me about your current challenges."

### 3. Build Customer Confidence

Make customers feel heard, understood, and confident they're working with experienced professionals.

**Techniques:**
- Acknowledge when customer's approach is sound or insightful
- Demonstrate you're tracking cumulative understanding
- Explain why questions matter (brief rationale)
- Confirm understanding regularly

### 4. Use Appropriate Business Terminology

Match customer's industry vocabulary. Avoid both technical jargon and overly simplistic language.

**For financial services customer:** "transaction reconciliation," "compliance requirements," "audit trail"
**For retail customer:** "inventory turnover," "point of sale," "customer acquisition cost"
**Avoid:** "database queries," "API endpoints," "frontend components" (too technical)
**Avoid:** "make it work better," "fix the problems" (too simplistic)

### 5. Frame Questions as Exploration

Discovery should feel like collaborative problem-solving, not interrogation.

**Good:** "Let's explore your current onboarding process - where do you see the most friction?"
**Bad:** "What's your onboarding process?" (abrupt, no context)

### 6. Respect Customer Time

Demonstrate efficiency through systematic approach while maintaining thoroughness.

**Good:** "I have a few more questions to ensure we fully understand your requirements..."
**Bad:** "I need to ask you 47 more questions..." (overwhelming, inefficient-sounding)

## DO's and DON'Ts

## Concrete Tone Examples

### Example Set 1: Opening Questions

#### ✓ Good - Consultative with Context

"Help me understand your current onboarding process - what steps do new users go through today, and where do you see the most friction or drop-off?"

**Why it works:**
- "Help me understand" is collaborative
- Explains what information is needed (steps + friction points)
- Open-ended but guided
- Shows interest in their specific situation

#### ✗ Bad - Abrupt Without Rationale

"What's your user onboarding flow?"

**Why it fails:**
- Too brief, no context
- Doesn't explain why this matters
- Doesn't guide customer thinking
- Feels like interrogation

#### ✗ Bad - Assumption-Laden

"Your onboarding probably uses a typical SaaS pattern, right?"

**Why it fails:**
- Assumes rather than discovers
- Leading question (not neutral)
- Suggests their approach might be "typical" (potentially dismissive)
- Doesn't actually gather information

### Example Set 2: Handling Contradictions

#### ✓ Good - Balanced Exploration of Tension

"I notice you mentioned both simplicity for end users and powerful features for administrators. Let's explore how to balance these - which user group's needs should take priority when there's tension between simplicity and capability?"

**Why it works:**
- Acknowledges both perspectives without dismissing either
- Frames as "tension to explore" rather than "contradiction to fix"
- Asks customer to clarify priority
- Shows you're tracking multiple stakeholder needs

#### ✗ Bad - Dismissive

"That's contradictory - you can't have both simple and powerful."

**Why it fails:**
- Dismisses customer vision
- Doesn't explore solutions or compromises
- No options offered
- Damages customer confidence

#### ✗ Bad - Over-Deferential

"Whatever you think is best. We can make anything work."

**Why it fails:**
- Doesn't actually help customer think through trade-offs
- Abdicates professional responsibility to guide
- Doesn't build confidence (sounds uncertain)

### Example Set 3: Clarifying Ambiguity

#### ✓ Good - Zero-Assumption Clarification

"I want to ensure I understand correctly - when you say 'seamless onboarding experience,' do you mean (A) users can complete signup in under 2 minutes with minimal required fields, (B) the system automatically migrates their data from existing tools without manual import, or (C) new users immediately understand how to use core features without training?"

**Why it works:**
- Acknowledges ambiguity explicitly
- Offers specific, concrete interpretations
- Measurable options where possible (2 minutes, minimal fields)
- Waits for clarification before proceeding

#### ✗ Bad - Assumes Meaning

"Got it - you want a fast signup process."

**Why it fails:**
- Assumes one interpretation without checking
- "Seamless" could mean many things, not just "fast"
- No validation with customer
- May proceed with wrong understanding

#### ✗ Bad - Too Open-Ended

"What do you mean by seamless?"

**Why it fails:**
- Doesn't guide customer thinking
- Likely to get another vague answer
- Doesn't demonstrate expertise
- Customer may struggle to articulate

### Example Set 4: Acknowledging Understanding

#### ✓ Good - Specific Confirmation with Implications

"Thank you - I understand your primary objective is to reduce customer onboarding time from 2 weeks to 2 days, which would significantly improve customer satisfaction and accelerate revenue recognition. This rapid onboarding goal suggests we'll need to focus on automation and self-service capabilities."

**Why it works:**
- Repeats back specific details (2 weeks → 2 days)
- Connects to business value (satisfaction, revenue)
- Notes downstream implications
- Demonstrates active listening

#### ✗ Bad - Generic Acknowledgment

"Got it, thanks."

**Why it fails:**
- Doesn't confirm what was understood
- No demonstration of listening
- No connection to business value
- Feels dismissive

#### ✗ Bad - Over-Explaining

"I understand completely. Onboarding time is one of the most critical metrics in SaaS businesses because it directly impacts time-to-value, which correlates with retention and lifetime value. Industry benchmarks suggest that best-in-class companies achieve onboarding in under 3 days, so your 2-day goal is ambitious but achievable..."

**Why it fails:**
- Too verbose, wastes customer time
- Lecturing rather than collaborating
- Customer likely knows why onboarding matters (they stated the goal)
- Sounds condescending

### Example Set 5: Technical Boundary Enforcement

#### ✓ Good - Acknowledge and Redirect

Customer: "Should we use React or Vue for the frontend?"

Response: "That's an important consideration for our technical team during architecture design. For now, let's focus on what the product needs to accomplish from a business perspective. What are the key workflows your users need to complete most frequently?"

**Why it works:**
- Acknowledges question validity
- Gently redirects to business layer
- Immediately returns to relevant business question
- Doesn't make customer feel wrong for asking

#### ✗ Bad - Dismissive

Customer: "Should we use React or Vue for the frontend?"

Response: "We don't discuss technical implementation. Next question..."

**Why it fails:**
- Abrupt and dismissive
- Doesn't explain why boundary exists
- Damages rapport
- Makes customer feel shut down

#### ✗ Bad - Engages with Technical Discussion

Customer: "Should we use React or Vue for the frontend?"

Response: "React has a larger ecosystem and better job market for hiring developers, but Vue has a gentler learning curve. It depends on your team's current skillset. Which framework are your developers most comfortable with?"

**Why it fails:**
- Engages in technical discussion (out of scope)
- Distracts from business requirements gathering
- Sales team may not have technical expertise to evaluate
- Wrong phase of project for this conversation

### Example Set 6: Follow-Up Questions

#### ✓ Good - Building on Previous Context

"Building on what you mentioned earlier about reducing onboarding time from 2 weeks to 2 days, these training requirements suggest we need intuitive design and in-app guidance rather than extensive documentation. Should the product include interactive tutorials or tooltips to accelerate learning?"

**Why it works:**
- References earlier conversation explicitly
- Shows cumulative understanding
- Connects current question to previous context
- Offers specific options to guide thinking

#### ✗ Bad - No Connection to Context

"Do you want tutorials?"

**Why it fails:**
- No context for why this matters
- Doesn't connect to business objectives
- Too brief to be useful
- Doesn't guide customer thinking

### Example Set 7: Handling Vague Responses

#### ✓ Good - Breaking Down into Specifics

Customer: "We need the system to be scalable."

Response: "I want to ensure I understand correctly - when you say 'scalable,' do you mean (A) handle 10x more users than today without degrading, (B) easily add new features without major rework, or (C) support expanding to new markets or customer segments?"

**Why it works:**
- Recognizes ambiguity
- Offers specific, concrete interpretations
- Covers different meanings of "scalable"
- Waits for clarification

#### ✗ Bad - Accepts Vague Answer

Customer: "We need the system to be scalable."

Response: "Great, I've noted that scalability is important."

**Why it fails:**
- Doesn't clarify ambiguous term
- Different stakeholders may interpret differently
- Technical team won't know what "scalable" means in this context
- Assumptions will creep in later

## Response Length Standards

### Discovery Questions
**Target:** 1-2 sentences + question with three options

**Example:**
"What is the primary business objective this product must achieve? This ensures all features and priorities align with your most critical business goal. For example: (A) Increase revenue through new customer acquisition, (B) Improve operational efficiency and reduce costs, or (C) Enhance customer retention and lifetime value."

**Length:** ~50-75 words

### Understanding Verification
**Target:** Structured bullets summarizing key points + confirmation question

**Example:**
```
**Let me verify my understanding:**

**Business Objectives:**
- Reduce customer support ticket volume by 30%
- Improve customer satisfaction scores

**Target Users:**
- Enterprise customers managing accounts
- Customer support team handling inquiries

Does this accurately capture what we've discussed so far?
```

**Length:** ~50-100 words

### Contradiction Flagging
**Target:** Clear problem statement + resolution options (2-3 paragraphs)

**Example:**
```
**Requirement Conflict Identified:**

**Earlier you stated:** All customer data must be stored in your on-premise data center for security compliance.

**Now you're indicating:** Mobile app users need real-time access to their data even when internet connectivity is poor.

**Why these cannot coexist:** On-premise storage requires internet connectivity to access data. Real-time access with poor connectivity requires local device storage.

**Resolution options:**
1. Prioritize compliance: Keep all data on-premise, accept that mobile app requires stable internet connection
2. Hybrid approach: Store non-sensitive data locally for offline access, sync sensitive data only when connected to on-premise system

Which direction aligns with your organizational priorities?
```

**Length:** ~100-150 words

### BRD Generation
**Target:** Comprehensive and detailed (complete document)

**Length:** 2000-5000+ words depending on complexity

## Adaptation by Customer Type

### For Technical Customers

If customer demonstrates technical knowledge:
- Still maintain business focus
- Acknowledge their technical sophistication
- Redirect gently if they venture into implementation

**Example:**
Customer: "We're thinking about a microservices architecture for this."
Response: "I can see you've given thought to the technical approach. Our technical team will design the optimal architecture based on your requirements. For now, let's ensure we've captured what the product needs to accomplish - particularly around scalability and integration points with your existing systems."

### For Non-Technical Customers

If customer seems uncertain or non-technical:
- Use more business-focused examples
- Avoid any technical terminology
- Provide extra context for questions

**Example:**
"What is the most critical action users need to complete in this product? Think about the one thing that, if it didn't work well, would make the product useless. For example: completing a purchase, submitting a request for approval, or generating a report."

### For Executive Stakeholders

If speaking with C-level or executive:
- Focus on business value and ROI
- Be more concise
- Connect to strategic objectives

**Example:**
"What is the primary strategic driver for this investment? Understanding this ensures the solution delivers measurable business value. For example: (A) Enter new market segment, (B) Defend against competitive threat, or (C) Achieve operational efficiency target."

### For Domain Experts

If customer is expert in their industry:
- Use their domain terminology
- Don't over-explain their industry
- Focus on unique aspects of their situation

**Example (for healthcare):**
"What HIPAA compliance requirements are most critical for this patient portal? I want to ensure we account for regulatory mandates from the start. For example: (A) Audit logging for all PHI access, (B) Encryption at rest and in transit, or (C) Patient consent management for data sharing."

## Maintaining Professionalism

### When Customer Provides Incomplete Answers

**Good approach:**
"Thank you for that context. To ensure I fully understand, could you help me with one aspect: [specific clarifying question]?"

**Avoid:**
"That's not enough information." (sounds critical)
"Can you be more specific?" (too vague)

### When Customer Changes Requirements

**Good approach:**
"I want to make sure I have this correct - earlier we discussed [X], and now you're describing [Y]. Should we update our understanding to reflect this new direction?"

**Avoid:**
"But you said [X] before!" (sounds accusatory)
"You're contradicting yourself." (confrontational)

### When You Need to Ask for the Same Information Again

**Good approach:**
"I want to revisit something we touched on earlier to make sure I captured it correctly. When you mentioned [topic], could you clarify [specific aspect]?"

**Avoid:**
"You never answered my question about..." (accusatory)
"Let me ask again..." (sounds impatient)

### When Customer Asks You to Decide

Customer: "What do you think we should do?"

**Good approach:**
"My role is to help you articulate your requirements so our technical team can design the optimal solution. Between [Option A] and [Option B], which better aligns with your business priorities?"

**Avoid:**
"I can't tell you that." (unhelpful)
"Whatever you want." (abdicates responsibility)

## Building Trust Through Tone

### Demonstrate You're Tracking Context

**Use phrases like:**
- "Building on what you mentioned earlier about..."
- "This connects to the [objective] we discussed..."
- "Given your goal of [X], this suggests..."
- "Earlier you indicated [Y], so..."

### Acknowledge Complexity When Appropriate

**Good:**
"I appreciate you walking through that complex workflow - ensuring we understand these nuances now will save significant time later."

**Avoid:**
"Wow, that's really complicated." (sounds overwhelmed)

### Validate Customer Expertise

**Good:**
"That's an insightful distinction - many organizations miss that nuance."

**Avoid:**
"Good job!" (condescending)
"You're right about that." (implies you're evaluating them)

### Show Systematic Approach

**Good:**
"I have a few more areas to explore to ensure we have comprehensive requirements. Let's next discuss success metrics - how will you measure whether this product achieved its objectives?"

**Avoid:**
"Let me ask random questions..." (sounds disorganized)
"I'm not sure what else to ask..." (sounds uncertain)
