# Business Requirements Document - Transcript Analysis & Extraction

# Business Requirements Document - AI-Powered Transcript Analysis & Requirement Extraction

- **Version:** 1.0 Draft
- **Author:** Generated by BA Assistant
- **Date:** October 24, 2023
- **Status:** Draft — Pending Review
- **Project:** Transcript Analysis & Requirement Extraction Feature
- **Scope:** End-to-end workflow for importing meeting transcripts, redacting sensitive information, extracting structured business artifacts (requirements, action items, decisions), and providing an interactive refinement interface.

## 1. Executive Summary
The BA Assistant application currently facilitates live discovery. This feature expansion aims to automate the post-meeting documentation process by allowing Business Analysts (BAs) to import meeting transcripts from external tools (Otter.ai, Microsoft Teams, Zoom). The system will use AI to extract key requirements, action items, and stakeholder concerns, reducing manual effort while increasing documentation completeness.

The primary objective is to reduce the time spent on documentation by 60% and ensure that critical stakeholder needs—especially edge cases—are not lost. The feature will support multiple roles, from Junior BAs to Project Managers, and includes high-security standards for financial and healthcare sectors.

## 2. Business Context
BAs currently spend approximately 45 minutes for every hour of meeting recorded to manually review, categorize, and document requirements. This process is prone to human error, particularly in long meetings (2+ hours), where subtle stakeholder concerns or complex edge cases may be overlooked. Furthermore, manual redaction of sensitive data for compliance (GDPR/HIPAA) is time-consuming and inconsistent.

## 3. Business Objectives
*   **Primary Objective:** Reduce documentation time from 45 minutes per meeting hour to under 15 minutes per meeting hour (a 66% reduction).
*   **Secondary Objective:** Achieve a requirements completeness score of >90% as audited by Senior BAs.
*   **Secondary Objective:** Standardize meeting output formats across the global BA team.
*   **Success Criterion:** Reach an 80% acceptance rate for AI-generated suggestions within 90 days of deployment.
*   **Adoption Goal:** 70% of active BAs to use the feature for at least one meeting per week within 6 months.

## 4. User Personas
*   **Junior BA (1-3 yrs experience):** Needs a structured starting point to overcome "blank page" syndrome and ensure all standard categories are captured.
*   **Senior BA (5+ yrs experience):** Focuses on high-level validation and refinement; requires efficiency in identifying high-impact requirements and conflicts.
*   **Project Manager (PM):** Primarily interested in tracking action items, deadlines, and project-affecting decisions.
*   **Consulting BA (Mobile-first):** Often works on-site; requires the ability to initiate transcript processing via mobile devices immediately after site visits.

## 5. User Flows and Journeys
### 5.1 Transcript Import to Structured Draft
1.  **Actor:** Junior BA / Consulting BA
2.  **User Goal:** Convert a 60-minute Zoom recording into a structured requirements draft.
3.  **Steps:**
    1.  User selects "Import Transcript" and uploads a supported file (Zoom/Teams/Otter).
    2.  User links the transcript to an existing Project in the BA Assistant.
    3.  System parses the file and identifies speakers.
    4.  System initiates the PII Redaction flow (see 5.2).
    5.  Once PII is cleared, System generates a categorized draft (Requirements, Actions, Decisions, Open Questions, Concerns).
    6.  User reviews the draft with confidence scores.

### 5.2 Hybrid PII Redaction
1.  **Actor:** BA (Any level)
2.  **User Goal:** Ensure HIPAA/GDPR compliance before AI processing.
3.  **Steps:**
    1.  System scans the raw transcript for patterns (SSNs, Account Numbers, Names, Emails).
    2.  System presents a "Redaction Preview" with flagged items highlighted.
    3.  User accepts, modifies, or adds redactions.
    4.  User provides "Sign-off" on the redacted transcript.
    5.  System destroys the unredacted temporary file and sends the redacted version for AI analysis.

## 6. Functional Requirements

### 6.1 Multi-Source Transcript Parsing (P0)
*   **Description:** Support for .vtt, .txt, and .docx formats from Otter.ai, Zoom, and Microsoft Teams.
*   **Business Rationale:** Enables cross-team adoption regardless of the meeting tool used.
*   **Complexity:** M
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   System must correctly map speaker labels from the source file to distinct internal IDs within 30 seconds of upload.
    *   If a file format is unrecognized, System must display a specific "Unsupported Format" error and provide a link to the supported formats guide.
    *   If the file contains no recognizable speaker timestamps, System must prompt the user to manually assign speakers before proceeding.

### 6.2 Hybrid PII Redaction Engine (P0)
*   **Description:** Automated detection and manual confirmation of sensitive data.
*   **Business Rationale:** Required for HIPAA/GDPR compliance in regulated industries.
*   **Complexity:** L
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   As a BA, I want the system to flag potential PII so that I can ensure client privacy before analysis.
    *   System must identify and flag at least 95% of standard PII patterns (emails, SSNs, phone numbers) in the review interface.
    *   **Exception:** If the PII detection service is unavailable, the system must prevent the analysis from proceeding and notify the user to try again in 5 minutes.
    *   **Exception:** If the user attempts to submit without reviewing flagged items, the system must require a mandatory "Redaction Review Complete" checkbox to be toggled.

### 6.3 Categorized Extraction & Confidence Scoring (P0)
*   **Description:** AI extraction into five categories with associated confidence metrics.
*   **Business Rationale:** Drives the 60% time-saving goal by organizing data automatically.
*   **Complexity:** XL
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   As a Junior BA, I want the system to categorize meeting points into Requirements, Action Items, Decisions, Questions, and Concerns so I don't have to manually sort them.
    *   System must provide a numerical confidence score (0-100) for every extracted item.
    *   Any item with a confidence score below the configured threshold (default: 70) must be visually highlighted with a "Needs Review" indicator.
    *   **Exception:** If the transcript is under 100 words, the system should notify the user that the file may be too short for meaningful analysis.
    *   **Exception:** If the AI model fails to categorize an item, it must be placed in a "Uncategorized" section for manual assignment.

### 6.4 Contextual Chat Refinement (P1)
*   **Description:** Post-extraction chat interface for deeper discovery.
*   **Business Rationale:** Allows BAs to probe for edge cases missed in the initial summary.
*   **Complexity:** M
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   As a Senior BA, I want to ask follow-up questions about the transcript context so that I can clarify stakeholder intent.
    *   System must respond to context-specific queries (e.g., "What did Persona X say about the timeline?") within 10 seconds.
    *   Responses must include a reference/link to the specific line number or timestamp in the redacted transcript.
    *   **Dependency:** Depends on US-6.1 (Parsing).

### 6.5 Project Memory Linking (P1)
*   **Description:** Association of transcript data with the broader project record.
*   **Business Rationale:** Prevents information silos and provides long-term discovery context.
*   **Complexity:** S
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   System must allow the user to select an active project from a dropdown during the upload flow.
    *   Once linked, all extracted requirements must be searchable within the Project Dashboard.

## 7. Business Processes
### 7.1 Current State
*   **Meeting ends** -> BA manually reviews recording/notes (45-90 mins) -> BA drafts document in Word/Confluence -> Stakeholder reviews -> Revisions made.
*   **Gap:** High manual effort, risk of missing compliance redactions, inconsistent quality.

### 7.2 Future State
*   **Meeting ends** -> BA uploads transcript -> System flags PII -> BA confirms redaction (2 mins) -> AI generates draft (1 min) -> BA refines via Chat (5-10 mins) -> Document finalized.
*   **Outcome:** ~15 mins total effort per meeting hour.
