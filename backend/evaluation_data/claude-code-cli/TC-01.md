## Document Metadata

- **Version:** 1.0 Draft
- **Author:** Generated by BA Assistant
- **Date:** 2026-02-15
- **Status:** Draft — Pending Review
- **Project:** User Authentication System for Fitness Coaching Mobile App
- **Scope:** Secure email/password authentication with password reset, session management, and account security features to enable client self-service access to workout plans and progress tracking

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This Business Requirements Document outlines the requirements for implementing a user authentication system for a fitness coaching mobile application. The primary objective is to enable 200 active personal training clients to securely access their workout plans and track progress through a self-service mobile application, eliminating the current manual email-based process.

The target users are fitness coaching clients aged 25-45 with moderate-to-high technical proficiency who already use fitness tracking devices. The authentication system will provide secure login via email and password, with password reset functionality, session management, and account security controls.

The business value of this implementation includes improved client experience through real-time access to updated workout plans, reduced operational overhead from manual email distribution, enhanced data accuracy, and improved client engagement with workout programs.

---

## 2. Business Context

### Current State Challenges

The fitness coaching company currently distributes workout plans to clients via email, which creates several operational and client experience challenges:

- **Manual Process Overhead:** Staff must manually email workout plans to 200+ clients, consuming significant time and resources
- **Delayed Updates:** When workout plans are modified, clients do not receive updates in real-time, leading to clients following outdated programs
- **Error-Prone Distribution:** Manual email distribution increases risk of sending incorrect plans to clients or missing clients entirely
- **Limited Progress Visibility:** Clients cannot track completed exercises in a centralized system, reducing accountability and progress monitoring
- **Poor Client Experience:** Clients must search through email threads to find current plans rather than accessing them instantly through a dedicated interface

### Market Drivers

- Growing client expectation for self-service digital experiences in fitness coaching
- Competitive pressure from fitness apps offering real-time plan access and progress tracking
- Client retention improvement through better engagement tools
- Operational efficiency needs as client base scales beyond 200 users

### Strategic Alignment

This authentication system serves as the foundation for a digital client experience platform that will:

- Enable scalable client management as the business grows
- Improve client retention through enhanced engagement and accessibility
- Reduce operational costs associated with manual plan distribution
- Create data foundation for future analytics and personalization features

---

## 3. Business Objectives

### Primary Objective

**Enable secure, self-service access to workout plans for personal training clients, eliminating manual email distribution and providing real-time plan updates.**

**Success Criteria:**

   - Measurement: Technical architecture review confirms extensibility

3. **Reduce Password-Related Support Burden**
   - Success Criteria: 95% of password reset requests are successfully self-serviced without staff intervention
   - Measurement: Track password reset completion rate and support ticket volume

---

## 4. User Personas

### Persona 1: Fitness Coaching Client (Primary User)

**Demographics:**
- Age: 25-45 years old
- Tech proficiency: Moderate to high (already uses fitness trackers and smartphone apps regularly)
- Client base size: ~200 active clients
- Usage context: Mobile-first usage (on-the-go access at gym, home, or outdoors)

**Role:**
Personal training client seeking to follow customized workout plans and track progress

**Pain Points:**
- Cannot easily find current workout plan among email threads
- Unaware when coach updates their plan — may follow outdated program

## 5. User Flows and Journeys

### User Flow 1: First-Time Login (New Client Onboarding)

**Persona:** Fitness Coaching Client  
**Business Goal:** Enable new clients to gain access to workout plans immediately after enrollment  
**User Goal:** Successfully log in to the app for the first time to view assigned workout plan

**Steps:**

1. Client receives welcome email from fitness coaching company with app download link and temporary credentials (email address and initial password)
2. Client downloads mobile app from app store
3. Client opens app and sees login screen
4. Client enters email address (provided by coach)
5. Client enters initial password (provided by coach)
6. Client taps "Log In" button
7. System validates credentials against user database
8. System creates secure session with 30-minute inactivity timeout
9. Client is redirected to workout plan dashboard showing current assigned plan
10. Client sees prompt to change password from temporary credential to personal password (optional but recommended flow for security)

**Expected Outcome:** Client successfully authenticates and views current workout plan within 2 minutes of opening app for the first time.

---

### User Flow 2: Routine Login (Returning User)

**Persona:** Fitness Coaching Client  
**Business Goal:** Enable frictionless access for returning clients to maintain engagement  
**User Goal:** Quickly log in to access workout plan before or during workout session

**Steps:**

1. Client opens mobile app
2. Client sees login screen (if no active session) or is automatically redirected to workout plan dashboard (if session still valid within 30-minute window)
3. If login required: Client enters email address
4. Client enters password
5. Client taps "Log In" button
6. System validates credentials
7. System creates secure session with 30-minute inactivity timeout
8. Client is redirected to workout plan dashboard showing current assigned plan with real-time updates

**Expected Outcome:** Returning client gains access to workout plan within 30 seconds of opening app. If session is still active, client bypasses login entirely and sees workout plan immediately.

---

### User Flow 3: Password Reset (Forgotten Password)

**Persona:** Fitness Coaching Client  
**Business Goal:** Minimize support burden from forgotten password requests while maintaining account security  
**User Goal:** Regain access to account without contacting support staff

**Steps:**

1. Client opens mobile app and sees login screen
2. Client realizes they cannot remember password
3. Client taps "Forgot Password?" link below login form
4. System displays password reset screen requesting email address
5. Client enters email address associated with their account
6. Client taps "Send Reset Link" button
7. System validates email exists in user database
8. System generates secure password reset token with 1-hour expiration
9. System sends password reset email to client's email address containing reset link
10. Client receives email and taps password reset link
11. System validates reset token (checks token is valid and not expired)
12. Client is directed to password reset form (either in mobile app or mobile-responsive web page)
13. Client enters new password
14. Client confirms new password (re-entry for validation)
15. Client taps "Reset Password" button
16. System validates new password meets security requirements (minimum length, complexity if applicable)
17. System updates user's password in database (encrypted)
18. System invalidates password reset token to prevent reuse
19. System displays success message and redirects client to login screen
20. Client logs in with new password using User Flow 2 (Routine Login)

**Expected Outcome:** Client successfully resets password and regains access within 5 minutes without staff intervention. 95% of password reset attempts are completed successfully without support tickets.

---

### User Flow 4: Account Lockout (Failed Login Attempts)

**Persona:** Fitness Coaching Client  
**Business Goal:** Protect client accounts from unauthorized access attempts while minimizing friction for legitimate users  
**User Goal:** Understand why login is blocked and regain access if legitimate user

**Steps:**

1. Client (or potential attacker) enters incorrect password on login screen
2. System validates credentials and determines password is incorrect
3. System increments failed login attempt counter for this account
4. System displays error message: "Incorrect email or password. Please try again."
5. Client attempts login again with incorrect credentials
6. Process repeats until failed login attempt threshold is reached (configurable limit, e.g., 5 attempts within 15 minutes)
7. System locks account temporarily (configurable duration, e.g., 15 minutes)
8. System displays error message: "Account temporarily locked due to multiple failed login attempts. Please try again in 15 minutes or use 'Forgot Password' to reset your password."
9. System sends security alert email to client's registered email address notifying them of lockout
10. **Scenario A (Legitimate User):** Client uses "Forgot Password" flow (User Flow 3) to reset password and regain immediate access
11. **Scenario B (Legitimate User):** Client waits 15 minutes for lockout period to expire, then successfully logs in with correct password
12. System automatically unlocks account after lockout duration expires
13. System resets failed login attempt counter to zero upon successful login

**Expected Outcome:** Brute-force password attacks are mitigated by temporary account lockout. Legitimate users who forget passwords are directed to self-service password reset. Security incidents are logged and clients are notified of suspicious activity.

## 6. Functional Requirements

### Priority Classification

- **P0 (Must-Have):** Core authentication functionality required for MVP launch. Without these, the system cannot achieve primary business objective.
- **P1 (Should-Have):** Important security and user experience features that significantly improve system quality but could be deferred to immediate post-launch if timeline requires.
- **P2 (Nice-to-Have):** Enhancements that improve user experience or provide future flexibility but are not critical for initial launch.

---

### P0 Must-Have Requirements

#### FR-01: Email and Password Login

**Description:**  
The system SHALL provide a login interface that accepts email address and password credentials and authenticates users against the client database.

**Business Rationale:**  
Core authentication mechanism required for clients to gain access to workout plans, eliminating manual email distribution process. Without login functionality, the primary business objective cannot be achieved.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **AC-01.1 (Happy Path):** When a client enters a valid registered email address and correct password, and taps the "Log In" button, the system SHALL validate credentials against the encrypted user database and redirect the client to the workout plan dashboard within 3 seconds of submission.

2. **AC-01.2 (Invalid Credentials):** When a client enters an email address that does not exist in the user database OR enters an incorrect password for a registered email address, the system SHALL display the error message "Incorrect email or password. Please try again." without revealing whether the email exists (security measure to prevent email enumeration attacks).

3. **AC-01.3 (Empty Fields Validation):** When a client attempts to submit the login form with either the email field or password field empty, the system SHALL display field-level validation errors ("Email is required" or "Password is required") and SHALL NOT submit the authentication request until both fields contain values.

4. **AC-01.4 (Session Creation):** Upon successful authentication, the system SHALL create a secure session token with a 30-minute inactivity timeout and store the session identifier securely (using HTTP-only cookies or secure token storage appropriate to mobile platform).

5. **AC-01.5 (Password Security):** The system SHALL store all user passwords using industry-standard encryption (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2 with appropriate cost factor) and SHALL NEVER store or log passwords in plain text.

**Error/Exception Scenarios:**

- **Database Connection Failure:** If the system cannot connect to the user database during login attempt, the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message ("Unable to connect. Please check your internet connection and try again.") and SHALL log the technical error details for administrator review.

- **Session Storage Failure:** If the system successfully authenticates credentials but fails to create or store the session token, the system SHALL display an error message ("Login temporarily unavailable. Please try again."), SHALL log the failure for investigation, and SHALL NOT grant access to the workout plan dashboard.

---

#### FR-02: Password Reset via Email

**Description:**  
The system SHALL provide a self-service password reset mechanism that sends a secure reset link to the user's registered email address and allows them to set a new password without staff intervention.

**Business Rationale:**  
Reduces support burden on coaching staff by enabling clients to independently resolve forgotten password issues. Supports business objective of minimizing operational overhead while maintaining account security.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **AC-02.1 (Request Password Reset):** When a client taps "Forgot Password?" on the login screen and enters their registered email address, the system SHALL generate a unique, cryptographically secure password reset token with a 1-hour expiration time and send an email to the registered address containing a password reset link (including the token as a parameter) within 30 seconds of request submission.

2. **AC-02.2 (Reset Token Validation):** When a client clicks the password reset link from their email, the system SHALL validate that the reset token is (a) valid (matches a generated token in database), (b) not expired (less than 1 hour since generation), and (c) not previously used. If any condition fails, the system SHALL display an error message ("This password reset link is invalid or has expired. Please request a new one.") and provide a button to return to the password reset request screen.

3. **AC-02.3 (New Password Submission):** When a client submits a new password via the password reset form, the system SHALL require password confirmation (client enters password twice) and SHALL validate that both entries match exactly before processing the reset. If passwords do not match, the system SHALL display the error message "Passwords do not match. Please try again." without submitting the request.

4. **AC-02.4 (Password Requirements Enforcement):** The system SHALL enforce configurable minimum password requirements (default: minimum 8 characters) and SHALL display validation error messages if the new password does not meet requirements (e.g., "Password must be at least 8 characters long").

5. **AC-02.5 (Successful Password Reset):** When a client successfully resets their password (valid token, matching password entries, requirements met), the system SHALL (a) update the user's password in the encrypted database, (b) invalidate the password reset token to prevent reuse, (c) send a confirmation email to the client notifying them that their password was changed, and (d) redirect the client to the login screen with a success message ("Your password has been reset successfully. Please log in with your new password.").

**Error/Exception Scenarios:**

- **Email Address Not Found:** When a client requests password reset for an email address that does not exist in the user database, the system SHALL still display the success message ("If this email address is registered, you will receive a password reset link shortly.") to prevent email enumeration attacks (do NOT reveal whether email exists), but SHALL NOT send any email or generate a reset token.

- **Email Delivery Failure:** If the system successfully generates a password reset token but the email service fails to deliver the reset email (e.g., SMTP server unavailable, email service rate limit exceeded), the system SHALL log the delivery failure with error details for administrator investigation, SHALL display a generic error message to the user ("Unable to send password reset email. Please try again later."), and SHALL NOT invalidate the existing active session (if any) or lockout the account.

---

#### FR-03: Session Management with 30-Minute Inactivity Timeout

**Description:**  
The system SHALL maintain secure user sessions that automatically expire after 30 minutes of user inactivity, requiring re-authentication to continue using the app.

**Business Rationale:**  
Balances security (protecting client workout data from unauthorized access if device is left unattended) with user convenience (avoiding frequent re-login during active workout sessions). Meets customer's specified security requirement for session timeouts.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **AC-03.1 (Session Duration Tracking):** When a client successfully logs in, the system SHALL create a session with a 30-minute inactivity timer that resets to 30 minutes each time the client performs any action within the app (tapping buttons, scrolling, marking exercises as complete, navigating between screens).

2. **AC-03.2 (Session Expiration After Inactivity):** When a client has not performed any action for 30 consecutive minutes, the system SHALL automatically expire the session, clear the stored session token from device storage, and redirect the client to the login screen when they next attempt to interact with the app (or when they return to the app from background).

3. **AC-03.3 (Session Expiration Notification):** When the system expires a session due to inactivity, the system SHALL display an informational message on the login screen ("Your session expired due to inactivity. Please log in again.") to inform the client why they were logged out (distinguishing from explicit logout or errors).

4. **AC-03.4 (Secure Session Storage):** The system SHALL store session tokens using platform-appropriate secure storage mechanisms (e.g., iOS Keychain, Android Keystore, or encrypted shared preferences) and SHALL NOT store session tokens in plain text or in easily accessible locations (e.g., unencrypted shared preferences, local storage without encryption).

5. **AC-03.5 (Session Validation on Protected Requests):** Before serving any request that accesses protected client data (e.g., fetching workout plans, marking exercises complete), the system SHALL validate that (a) a session token exists, (b) the session token is valid (matches an active session in the database or cache), and (c) the session has not exceeded the 30-minute inactivity window. If any validation fails, the system SHALL return an authentication error and redirect the client to the login screen.

**Error/Exception Scenarios:**

- **Session Token Corruption:** If the system detects a corrupted or tampered session token during validation (e.g., malformed token, signature validation failure for JWT tokens), the system SHALL immediately invalidate the session, clear the token from device storage, redirect the client to the login screen with the message "Your session is invalid. Please log in again.", and SHALL log the security event for administrator review.

- **Clock Skew Issues:** If the client device's system clock is significantly out of sync with the server clock (e.g., client device time is set incorrectly), and this causes premature or delayed session expiration, the system SHALL rely on server-side timestamps for session expiration decisions (do NOT trust client-side time) and SHALL log a warning if large time discrepancies are detected (indicating potential security issue or user experience problem).

---

#### FR-04: Account Lockout After Multiple Failed Login Attempts

**Description:**  
The system SHALL temporarily lock user accounts after a configurable number of consecutive failed login attempts within a configurable time window to protect against brute-force password attacks.

**Business Rationale:**  
Protects client accounts from unauthorized access attempts while balancing security with user experience. Addresses customer's stated need to "handle the case where someone tries too many wrong passwords — maybe lock them out temporarily."

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **AC-04.1 (Failed Attempt Tracking):** When a client enters incorrect login credentials (wrong email or wrong password for valid email), the system SHALL increment a failed login attempt counter for that specific user account (associated with the email address) and SHALL store the timestamp of each failed attempt.

2. **AC-04.2 (Lockout Threshold):** When the failed login attempt counter for a user account reaches the configured threshold (default: 5 consecutive failed attempts) within the configured time window (default: 15 minutes), the system SHALL immediately lock the account for the configured lockout duration (default: 15 minutes) and SHALL prevent any login attempts (even with correct password) until the lockout period expires.

3. **AC-04.3 (Lockout Error Message):** When a client attempts to log in to a locked account (whether with correct or incorrect credentials), the system SHALL display the error message "Account temporarily locked due to multiple failed login attempts. Please try again in [X] minutes or use 'Forgot Password' to reset your password." where [X] is the remaining lockout duration in minutes.

4. **AC-04.4 (Security Alert Email):** When an account is locked due to failed login attempts, the system SHALL send an automated security alert email to the registered email address within 60 seconds of lockout, informing the client of the lockout and providing instructions to (a) wait for automatic unlock or (b) use password reset if they forgot their password or suspect unauthorized access.

5. **AC-04.5 (Automatic Unlock):** When the configured lockout duration expires (default: 15 minutes from lockout timestamp), the system SHALL automatically unlock the account and reset the failed login attempt counter to zero, allowing the client to attempt login again. The client does not need to take any action for unlock to occur.

6. **AC-04.6 (Counter Reset on Successful Login):** When a client successfully logs in with correct credentials (before reaching lockout threshold), the system SHALL immediately reset the failed login attempt counter to zero for that account.

7. **AC-04.7 (Password Reset Bypass):** When a client uses the password reset flow (FR-02) to successfully reset their password while their account is locked, the system SHALL (a) unlock the account immediately upon successful password reset, (b) reset the failed login attempt counter to zero, and (c) allow the client to log in with the new password without waiting for lockout duration to expire.

**Error/Exception Scenarios:**

- **Email Delivery Failure for Security Alert:** If the system successfully locks an account but fails to send the security alert email (e.g., email service unavailable), the system SHALL still enforce the lockout (security takes precedence), SHALL log the email delivery failure for administrator review, and SHALL retry email delivery once (with exponential backoff) before giving up.

- **Distributed Attack Mitigation:** If the system detects an unusually high rate of failed login attempts across many different email addresses (potential distributed brute-force attack across multiple accounts), the system SHALL log the security event for administrator investigation and SHOULD consider implementing rate-limiting measures at the IP address or device level (future enhancement — not required for MVP but architecture should support).

---

### P1 Should-Have Requirements

#### FR-05: Email Validation Format

**Description:**  
The system SHALL validate that email addresses entered in login and password reset forms conform to standard email format (presence of @ symbol, valid domain format) before attempting authentication or password reset operations.

**Business Rationale:**  
Reduces unnecessary authentication requests and improves user experience by catching typos early. Prevents system overhead from processing malformed email addresses.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **AC-05.1 (Format Validation):** When a client enters an email address in the login form or password reset request form and attempts to submit, the system SHALL validate that the email follows standard email format (contains exactly one @ symbol, has characters before and after @, domain portion contains at least one period, no invalid characters) and SHALL display the error message "Please enter a valid email address" if format validation fails.

2. **AC-05.2 (Real-Time Validation Feedback):** The system SHALL perform email format validation in real-time as the client types (with debounce to avoid excessive validation checks) or upon blur (client taps outside the email field), providing immediate feedback without requiring form submission.

**Error/Exception Scenarios:**

- **Edge Case Email Formats:** If a client enters an email address with unusual but technically valid formatting (e.g., email+tag@domain.com, email@subdomain.domain.com), the system SHALL accept the email address as valid (do NOT reject valid RFC-compliant formats) and SHALL attempt authentication or password reset as normal.

---

#### FR-06: Password Visibility Toggle

**Description:**  
The system SHALL provide a visibility toggle (show/hide button) for password fields to allow clients to verify their password entry before submission.

**Business Rationale:**  
Improves user experience by reducing login failures due to typos in password entry. Particularly valuable for mobile users entering passwords on small touchscreen keyboards.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **AC-06.1 (Toggle Functionality):** When a client taps the visibility toggle icon (typically an eye icon) next to the password field, the system SHALL toggle password display between masked characters (•••••••) and plain text, allowing the client to verify their password entry. Tapping the icon again SHALL return the password to masked display.

2. **AC-06.2 (Default Masked State):** The system SHALL display password fields in masked state (•••••••) by default when the login or password reset screen loads, requiring explicit client action to reveal plain text.

**Error/Exception Scenarios:**

- None identified for MVP. Standard UI control with minimal failure scenarios.

---

#### FR-07: Secure HTTPS Communication

**Description:**  
The system SHALL encrypt all authentication-related network communication (login requests, password reset requests, session token transmission) using HTTPS/TLS to protect credentials in transit.

**Business Rationale:**  
Prevents credential interception by malicious actors on unsecured networks (public Wi-Fi, compromised routers). Industry-standard security requirement for any authentication system.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **AC-07.1 (HTTPS Enforcement):** The system SHALL transmit all authentication requests (login, password reset, session validation) over HTTPS with valid TLS certificates and SHALL reject any attempt to downgrade to unencrypted HTTP connections.

2. **AC-07.2 (Certificate Validation):** The mobile app SHALL validate server SSL/TLS certificates against trusted certificate authorities and SHALL refuse connections if certificate validation fails (expired certificate, self-signed certificate in production, certificate hostname mismatch).

**Error/Exception Scenarios:**

- **Certificate Validation Failure:** If the mobile app cannot validate the server's SSL/TLS certificate (e.g., certificate expired, untrusted issuer, hostname mismatch), the system SHALL refuse to establish a connection, SHALL display a user-friendly error message ("Unable to establish secure connection. Please check your internet connection and try again."), and SHALL log the technical certificate error details for administrator investigation. The system SHALL NOT allow the client to bypass certificate validation (no "accept anyway" option).

---

### P2 Nice-to-Have Requirements

#### FR-08: Remember Email Address

**Description:**  
The system MAY store the client's email address locally on the device after successful login, pre-populating the email field on subsequent login attempts to reduce typing friction.

**Business Rationale:**  
Improves convenience for returning users by reducing login friction. Most users log in from the same device repeatedly.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **AC-08.1 (Email Storage):** When a client successfully logs in, the system MAY offer to remember the email address (opt-in via checkbox or system-level permission) and store it securely in device storage for pre-population on next login attempt.

2. **AC-08.2 (Pre-Population):** When a returning client opens the login screen, the system SHALL pre-populate the email field with the stored email address (if available and client previously opted in), allowing the client to immediately enter password without retyping email.

**Error/Exception Scenarios:**

- None identified for MVP. Optional feature with minimal failure impact.

---

#### FR-09: Login Activity Logging

**Description:**  
The system MAY log successful login events (timestamp, device type, approximate location from IP address if available) and display recent login activity to clients via account settings screen.

**Business Rationale:**  
Provides transparency and security awareness for clients. Allows clients to detect unauthorized access to their accounts. Future foundation for security features.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **AC-09.1 (Login Event Logging):** When a client successfully logs in, the system MAY record a login event including timestamp, device type/operating system, and approximate geographic location derived from IP address (if available and permissible under privacy regulations).

2. **AC-09.2 (Activity Display):** The system MAY display recent login activity (last 10 login events) in an account settings or security section, allowing clients to review when and from which devices they accessed their account.

**Error/Exception Scenarios:**

- None identified for MVP. Optional future enhancement with minimal implementation priority.

---

## 7. Business Processes

### Process 1: Client Onboarding and Initial Access Setup

**Current State:**  
New clients sign training contracts in person or via email. Coaches manually create workout plans and email them to clients. No formal digital account provisioning process exists. Clients have no app access until manually configured.

**Future State (With Authentication System):**  
When a new client enrolls, coaching staff creates a user account in the system with the client's email address and generates a temporary password. The system sends an automated welcome email containing app download links (iOS/Android) and temporary credentials. Client downloads app, logs in with temporary credentials, and gains immediate access to their assigned workout plan. Client is prompted (but not forced) to change password from temporary credential to personal password for security.

**Process Flow:**

1. Client enrolls in personal training program (business process outside system scope)
2. Coach or staff member creates user account in admin interface (future phase — manual database entry acceptable for MVP)
3. System generates temporary password for new account
4. System sends welcome email to client with app download links and temporary credentials
5. Client receives email and downloads mobile app
6. Client uses temporary credentials to complete first-time login (User Flow 1)
7. Client accesses workout plan dashboard and begins using app
8. Client optionally changes password from temporary to personal (recommended but not enforced in MVP)

**Stakeholders Involved:**

- **Fitness Coaches:** Create client accounts and assign initial workout plans
- **Administrative Staff:** May assist with account provisioning for new clients
- **Clients:** Receive credentials and complete first-time login
- **IT/System Administrator (if applicable):** Troubleshoot failed account creation or email delivery issues

**Process Impact:**  
Reduces onboarding friction from "email-based plan distribution" to "instant app access upon enrollment." Eliminates delay between client enrollment and first plan access.

---

### Process 2: Routine Workout Plan Access

**Current State:**  
Clients search email inbox for most recent workout plan email from coach. If plan was updated, clients may not realize they have a newer version and continue following outdated program. Clients print plans or keep email open on phone during workouts.

**Future State (With Authentication System):**  
Clients open mobile app (no login required if session still active within 30 minutes), immediately see current workout plan with real-time updates. When coaches publish plan changes, clients see updated version instantly upon next app open. Clients mark exercises as complete during workout (tracking functionality — separate from authentication scope but enabled by authentication).

**Process Flow:**

1. Client prepares for workout session
2. Client opens mobile app on smartphone
3. System checks for active session (within 30-minute window)
   - **If active session:** Client bypasses login and sees workout plan dashboard immediately
   - **If expired session:** Client completes routine login (User Flow 2) in under 30 seconds
4. Client views current workout plan with any real-time updates published by coach
5. Client completes workout, marking exercises as done within app
6. Session remains active for next workout (if within 30 minutes) or expires after inactivity

**Stakeholders Involved:**

- **Clients:** Primary users accessing workout plans before and during workouts
- **Fitness Coaches:** Publish updated plans that clients see in real-time (separate process from authentication but enabled by client access)

**Process Impact:**  
Eliminates email search friction. Ensures clients always work from current plan version. Improves client experience and workout efficiency.

---

### Process 3: Password Reset and Account Recovery

**Current State:**  
When clients forget credentials (not applicable currently — no authentication system exists), they contact coaching staff via email or phone. Staff manually resolve issue, potentially requiring password reset or re-sending credentials.

**Future State (With Authentication System):**  
Clients who forget passwords use self-service password reset flow (User Flow 3). System sends password reset email automatically. Client completes reset within 5 minutes without staff involvement. Staff only intervenes if email delivery fails or client reports technical issues (edge cases).

**Process Flow:**

1. Client attempts to log in but cannot remember password
2. Client taps "Forgot Password?" link on login screen
3. Client enters registered email address and requests reset
4. System sends password reset email to client within 30 seconds
5. Client clicks reset link from email
6. Client sets new password via reset form
7. System confirms successful password reset
8. Client logs in with new password using routine login flow
9. **Edge Case:** If client does not receive email within 5 minutes, client contacts support. Staff verifies email address in system and manually resends reset email or investigates email delivery issue.

**Stakeholders Involved:**

- **Clients:** Complete self-service password reset in majority of cases
- **Support Staff/Coaches:** Intervene only when self-service fails (email delivery issues, technical problems)
- **IT/System Administrator (if applicable):** Investigate email service issues if delivery failures occur

**Process Impact:**  
Reduces support burden on coaching staff by enabling self-service password recovery. Expected 95% self-service completion rate (5% requiring staff intervention).

## 10. Regulatory and Compliance Requirements

### Data Privacy and Protection

Given that the fitness coaching company collects and stores client email addresses and authentication credentials, the following compliance considerations apply:

**GDPR (if clients are in EU/EEA):**  
- The system SHALL obtain explicit consent from clients for storing email addresses and authentication data
- The system SHALL provide clients with ability to request data deletion (account deletion) in future phases
- The system SHALL implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data (encrypted password storage, HTTPS communication, secure session management)

**CCPA (if clients are in California, USA):**  
- The system SHALL disclose data collection practices in privacy policy
- The system SHALL provide mechanism for clients to request data access or deletion in future phases

**PIPEDA (if clients are in Canada):**  
- The system SHALL limit data collection to what is necessary for authentication purposes (email, password, session data)
- The system SHALL protect personal data with appropriate safeguards (encryption, secure storage)

**General Data Security Best Practices:**  
- The system SHALL encrypt passwords using industry-standard algorithms (bcrypt, Argon2, PBKDF2)
- The system SHALL encrypt network communication using HTTPS/TLS
- The system SHALL implement session management best practices (secure token storage, appropriate timeout)
- The system SHALL log security events (failed logins, lockouts) for monitoring and incident response

### Industry Standards

**OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) Guidelines:**  
- The system SHALL follow OWASP authentication best practices including secure password storage, protection against brute-force attacks, secure session management, and input validation

### Certification Requirements

**None identified for MVP.**  
The fitness coaching industry does not require specific certifications for client authentication systems. However, if the company processes payment card data in future phases (subscriptions, in-app purchases), PCI DSS compliance will be required.

### Audit Requirements

**None identified for MVP.**  
No regulatory audits are required for basic authentication systems in the fitness coaching industry. However, the system SHOULD maintain comprehensive audit logs (login events, password resets, security incidents) to support internal security reviews and incident investigation.

## 11. Assumptions and Constraints

### Assumptions

1. **Email Accessibility:** Clients have reliable access to the email addresses they provide for account registration and can receive password reset emails within minutes.

2. **Mobile Device Ownership:** All 200 active clients own smartphones (iOS or Android) capable of running the mobile app.

3. **Technical Proficiency:** Clients have moderate-to-high technical proficiency and are comfortable using standard mobile app login interfaces without extensive training.

4. **Single Account Per Client:** Each client will have exactly one user account associated with their email address. Shared accounts or multiple accounts per client are not supported in MVP.

5. **Account Provisioning:** During MVP phase, fitness coaches or staff will manually create user accounts (potentially via direct database entry or basic admin interface). Automated account provisioning from business management systems is a future enhancement.

6. **Email Service Availability:** The coaching company has an existing email service (SMTP server, transactional email provider like SendGrid/Mailgun, or corporate email) capable of sending automated emails for password resets and welcome messages.

7. **User Database Exists:** A user database (or can be created) to store client accounts, encrypted passwords, session tokens, and authentication-related data.

8. **Internet Connectivity:** Clients have reliable internet connectivity (Wi-Fi or mobile data) when accessing the app. Offline functionality is not required for authentication in MVP.

9. **Client Contact Information Accuracy:** Email addresses provided by clients during enrollment are accurate and actively monitored. Clients will notify coaching staff if email address changes.

10. **No Regulatory Blockers:** No industry-specific regulations prevent implementation of email/password authentication for fitness coaching clients. (See Section 10 for data privacy considerations.)

11. **Session Timeout Acceptance:** 30-minute inactivity timeout is acceptable to clients and will not cause significant frustration. This assumption should be validated post-launch via user feedback.

12. **Single-Device Usage (Primarily):** Most clients will primarily use the app from a single mobile device, though the system should technically support login from multiple devices (future consideration).

---

### Constraints

1. **Budget Constraint:** Project budget must align with small business financial capacity. Prefer cost-effective authentication solutions (standard implementation rather than enterprise-grade identity platforms like Okta).

2. **Timeline Constraint:** System should launch within 8-12 weeks to address current operational pain points and capitalize on new client enrollment period (assumed based on typical small business urgency).

3. **No Social Login (MVP):** Social login (Sign in with Google, Sign in with Apple, Sign in with Facebook) is explicitly excluded from MVP scope per customer preference. Email/password authentication only.

4. **No Multi-Factor Authentication (MVP):** Multi-factor authentication (SMS codes, authenticator apps, biometric authentication) is not required for MVP. May be considered as future enhancement if security concerns arise.

5. **Mobile-First Implementation:** Authentication system is designed for mobile app usage. Web browser access is not prioritized for MVP (though responsive web design may be considered if technically feasible without additional scope).

6. **Limited Admin Interface (MVP):** MVP may have minimal or no graphical admin interface for account management. Manual database operations for account provisioning are acceptable for 200-client scale. Full admin dashboard is future enhancement.

7. **No Role-Based Access Control (MVP):** MVP supports single user role (client). Coach/staff/admin roles and associated permissions are future enhancements. Authentication system architecture should support future role expansion.

8. **Session Storage Limitations:** Session management must work within mobile platform constraints (iOS app lifecycle, Android background process restrictions). Sessions cannot persist indefinitely without server-side validation.

9. **Email Delivery Dependency:** Password reset functionality depends on email delivery. If email service fails, password reset is unavailable until resolved. System should gracefully handle email failures with user-friendly messages and administrator alerts.

10. **No Account Self-Registration (MVP):** Clients cannot create their own accounts via app. Accounts must be provisioned by coaching staff. Self-registration may be future enhancement but introduces business process changes (payment collection, plan assignment workflows).

11. **Platform Compatibility:** Mobile app must support iOS (minimum version TBD by development team) and Android (minimum version TBD). Very old device models may not be supported if OS versions are incompatible.

12. **Network Dependency:** All authentication operations require active internet connection. No offline authentication mode in MVP.

## 12. Risks and Mitigation Strategies

| Risk | Impact (1-5) | Likelihood (1-5) | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Low Client Adoption** — Clients prefer familiar email-based plan distribution and resist adopting app | **Impact: 5** (Undermines entire project value proposition) | **Likelihood: 2** (Clients are tech-savvy; app provides clear value) | - Conduct user onboarding sessions (in-person or video) to demonstrate app value<br>- Provide email reminders with app download links and first-login instructions<br>- Coaches actively encourage app usage during training sessions<br>- Track adoption metrics weekly and follow up personally with non-adopters<br>- Continue email distribution for 4-week transition period if needed |
| **Password Reset Email Delivery Failures** — Email service fails or emails are filtered to spam, preventing clients from completing password resets | **Impact: 4** (High support burden; frustrated clients) | **Likelihood: 3** (Email deliverability issues are common) | - Use reputable transactional email service (SendGrid, Mailgun) with high deliverability rates<br>- Implement SPF, DKIM, DMARC email authentication records to prevent spam filtering<br>- Include clear "Add to safe senders" instructions in welcome email<br>- Monitor email delivery success rates and investigate failures promptly<br>- Provide fallback: clients can contact support for manual password reset if email fails |
| **Session Timeout Frustration** — 30-minute inactivity timeout logs clients out mid-workout, causing frustration | **Impact: 3** (User experience degradation; support complaints) | **Likelihood: 3** (Clients may pause workouts longer than 30 minutes) | - Monitor session timeout-related support complaints post-launch<br>- If complaints exceed 5 per month, consider extending timeout to 60 minutes<br>- Provide clear messaging when session expires: "Your session expired due to inactivity. Please log in again."<br>- Ensure login process is fast (<5 seconds) to minimize frustration when re-authentication required<br>- Consider "Remember Email" feature (FR-08) to reduce relogin friction |
| **Account Lockout False Positives** — Legitimate clients locked out due to forgotten passwords or typos, causing access frustration | **Impact: 3** (Support burden; client frustration) | **Likelihood: 4** (Password typos and forgotten passwords are common) | - Set reasonable lockout threshold (5 failed attempts, not 3) to tolerate typos<br>- Display clear lockout message with instructions to use password reset or wait for auto-unlock<br>- Ensure password reset flow is fast and reliable (see mitigation above)<br>- Send security alert email when lockout occurs so client is aware and can take action<br>- Track lockout incidents monthly; if exceeding 10 per month, consider adjusting threshold |
| **Security Breach / Unauthorized Access** — Attacker gains access to client accounts through credential theft, brute-force, or system vulnerability | **Impact: 5** (Data breach; reputational damage; legal liability; client trust loss) | **Likelihood: 2** (Low if security best practices followed) | - Enforce strong password storage (bcrypt/Argon2 with appropriate cost factor)<br>- Encrypt all network communication with HTTPS/TLS<br>- Implement account lockout to prevent brute-force attacks<br>- Conduct security code review and penetration testing before launch<br>- Monitor failed login attempts and lockout events for suspicious patterns<br>- Implement security logging and incident response procedures<br>- Consider future enhancement: multi-factor authentication (MFA) if security concerns arise |
| **Email Address Changes Not Updated** — Client changes email address but does not update account, losing access to password reset and notifications | **Impact: 3** (Client cannot recover account without support intervention) | **Likelihood: 2** (Email changes are infrequent but occur) | - Provide email update feature in account settings (future enhancement)<br>- Coaches inform clients to notify staff if email changes<br>- Support staff can manually update email address in database when client reports change<br>- Future enhancement: Require email verification when updating email address |
| **Single Point of Failure: Email Service** — If email service is unavailable, password resets fail, and new clients cannot receive welcome emails | **Impact: 4** (Blocks onboarding; blocks password recovery) | **Likelihood: 2** (Reputable email services have high uptime) | - Use reliable transactional email provider with SLA guarantees<br>- Implement retry logic for failed email sends (exponential backoff)<br>- Monitor email service health and set up alerts for delivery failures<br>- Provide manual fallback: support staff can manually provision temporary passwords if email service down<br>- Document email service recovery procedures in operations runbook |
| **Scope Creep** — Stakeholders request additional features (social login, MFA, role-based access, admin dashboard) during development, delaying launch | **Impact: 3** (Timeline delay; budget overrun) | **Likelihood: 4** (Feature requests are common during development) | - Clearly define MVP scope in this BRD with explicit exclusions (no social login, no MFA in MVP)<br>- Use priority classification (P0/P1/P2) to defer nice-to-have features<br>- Establish change control process: new feature requests documented and scheduled for post-MVP phases<br>- Regularly communicate project status and timeline impact of scope changes to stakeholders<br>- Maintain product backlog for future enhancements |
