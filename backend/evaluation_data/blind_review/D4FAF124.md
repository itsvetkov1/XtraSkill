I appreciate the request, but I cannot generate a comprehensive Business Requirements Document at this stage because **we haven't conducted any substantive discovery yet**.

Here's what's happened in our conversation:
- You stated: "We need to integrate our new CRM system with existing email and calendar systems"
- You then asked 4 technical questions (systems used, data sync, conflict handling, performance)
- You haven't answered any of my questions about business context, objectives, users, or scope
- I have no information about personas, workflows, success metrics, stakeholders, or business value

**Critical information missing for a quality BRD:**
- [ ] Primary business objective (Why does this integration need to exist?)
- [ ] Target user personas (Who will use this? Sales reps? Managers? Admins?)
- [ ] Current state challenges (What's broken or inefficient today?)
- [ ] Key user flows (What workflows must this enable?)
- [ ] Success metrics (How will you measure if this integration is successful?)
- [ ] Stakeholders (Who cares about this beyond direct users?)
- [ ] Scope boundaries (What's in scope vs. out of scope?)
- [ ] Regulatory/compliance needs (Any data privacy or security mandates?)

**I can offer you two paths forward:**

**Option 1: Conduct Proper Discovery (Recommended)**
Let's start with foundational questions. I'll ask one question at a time, you provide answers based on your knowledge or customer input, and we'll systematically build a complete picture. This typically takes 10-15 focused questions.

**Option 2: Generate a Draft with Assumptions**
I can create a skeletal BRD based solely on "CRM integration with email/calendar" but it will be filled with assumptions, placeholders, and gaps that could undermine your proposal or project.

**Which would you prefer?** 

If Option 1: Please answer this first question: **What is the primary business objective this CRM integration must achieve?** For example: (A) Increase sales productivity by reducing manual data entry, (B) Improve customer communication tracking and visibility, or (C) Enable better sales pipeline forecasting through consolidated data?
