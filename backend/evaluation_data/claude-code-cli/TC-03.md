## Document Metadata

- **Version:** 1.0 Draft
- **Author:** Generated by BA Assistant
- **Date:** 2026-02-15
- **Status:** Draft — Pending Review
- **Project:** Southeast Asian Artisan E-commerce Marketplace
- **Scope:** Complete marketplace platform enabling seller onboarding, product listings, buyer purchasing, payment processing, dispute resolution, reviews, recommendations, and administrative management across multiple countries and currencies in Southeast Asia.

## 1. Executive Summary

This Business Requirements Document outlines the requirements for a regional e-commerce marketplace platform focused on handmade crafts and artisan goods in Southeast Asia. The platform connects verified artisan sellers with local and international buyers, facilitating transactions in multiple currencies and languages while providing comprehensive administrative oversight and dispute resolution mechanisms.

The platform differentiates itself from global competitors by focusing specifically on Southeast Asian artisan goods, supporting regional payment gateways and shipping carriers, and providing localized experiences across English, Malay, and Thai languages. The business model centers on a 10% transaction commission with biweekly seller payouts and a 14-day dispute resolution hold period.

Target launch includes 50 verified sellers with growth projections to 500 sellers within the first year. The platform serves three primary user groups: artisan sellers managing their storefronts and inventory, buyers discovering and purchasing unique handmade products, and platform administrators ensuring quality, compliance, and operational excellence.

---

## 2. Business Context

### Current Market Landscape

The global artisan marketplace sector is dominated by international platforms that lack regional focus and localized support for Southeast Asian sellers and buyers. Existing platforms often impose complex international payment structures, limited language support, and shipping integrations that don't prioritize regional carriers popular in Southeast Asia.

### Strategic Opportunity

By creating a regionally-focused marketplace with native support for local currencies (USD, SGD, MYR, THB), languages (English, Malay, Thai), and shipping carriers (J&T Express, Ninja Van, alongside DHL and FedEx), the platform addresses an underserved market segment. The manual seller verification process ensures quality control and builds buyer trust, while the dispute resolution framework balances buyer protection with seller fairness.

### Competitive Differentiation

- **Regional Focus:** Curated selection of Southeast Asian artisan goods
- **Localization:** Multi-currency, multi-language support tailored to the region
- **Shipping Integration:** Priority integration with popular regional carriers
- **Quality Assurance:** Manual seller verification and automated quality flagging based on review thresholds
- **Trust & Safety:** Structured dispute resolution with mediation and platform arbitration

**Description:** System SHALL automatically flag products for quality review when they accumulate a configurable minimum number of reviews (default: 10 reviews) AND their average rating falls below a configurable threshold (default: 3.0 stars).

**Business Rationale:** Proactive quality control identifies consistently poor-performing products for administrator intervention, protecting buyer experience and platform reputation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. System SHALL monitor product review metrics in real-time after each new review submission
2. When product meets trigger conditions (review count >= configurable minimum, default: 10 AND average rating < configurable threshold, default: 3.0 stars), system SHALL create quality flag record with status "Flagged - Quality Review Required"
3. System SHALL add flagged product to administrator content moderation queue with flag reason "Low Average Rating: [X.X stars] based on [N] reviews"
4. Administrator SHALL receive daily digest email listing all newly flagged products requiring quality review
5. Administrator SHALL be able to access flagged product details including: product listing, all reviews, seller history, dispute history
6. Administrator SHALL take action: Request Seller Improvements (send template message with specific improvement requirements), Delist Product (remove from marketplace immediately with notification to seller and existing buyers), Monitor Further (dismiss flag and continue monitoring)
7. If "Request Seller Improvements" action taken, system SHALL notify seller via email with improvement requirements and deadline (configurable, default: 7 days)
8. If seller updates product listing addressing improvements within deadline, administrator SHALL review updates and decide to re-enable or delist
9. If "Delist Product" action taken, system SHALL change product status to "Delisted - Quality Issues", hide product from buyer search and browsing, notify seller with explanation and appeal process
10. System SHALL track flag resolution history (date flagged, date resolved, action taken, outcome)

**Error/Exception Scenarios:**
- If product accumulates exactly the threshold number of reviews (e.g., 10) and average rating is exactly the threshold value (e.g., 3.0 stars), system SHALL NOT flag the product; flagging SHALL only occur when rating is strictly below threshold (<3.0, not <=3.0)
- If administrator dismisses quality flag with "Monitor Further" action, but product later receives additional low ratings bringing average further below threshold, system SHALL NOT re-flag the same product within a configurable cooldown period (default: 30 days) to avoid alert fatigue; after cooldown, product becomes eligible for re-flagging if conditions persist

**Priority:** P0 (Must Have)  
**Complexity:** M (Medium)

## 7. Business Processes

### Process 1: Seller Onboarding and Verification

**Current State:** Sellers join global platforms with automated or minimal verification, leading to quality concerns and buyer trust issues.

**Future State:** Sellers undergo manual verification process with document review to ensure only legitimate artisan businesses join the platform.

**Process Flow:**
1. Prospective seller discovers platform through marketing, referral, or search
2. Seller completes registration form with business details
3. Seller uploads required verification documents (business registration, government ID, bank account info)
4. Platform administrator receives verification request in queue
5. Administrator reviews documents for authenticity and completeness within 48-hour SLA
6. Administrator approves or rejects application with reasoning
7. Approved seller receives confirmation and gains access to seller dashboard
8. Seller completes profile setup and lists first product
9. Product goes live on marketplace

**Stakeholders:** Prospective sellers (artisan business owners), Platform administrators (verification team)

---

### Process 2: Transaction and Payout Cycle

**Current State:** Traditional e-commerce platforms may have complex payout schedules or long fund holding periods without transparency.

**Future State:** Transparent biweekly payout schedule with clear fund hold period for dispute resolution, balancing seller cash flow needs with buyer protection.

**Process Flow:**
1. Buyer completes purchase and payment is authorized
2. Platform deducts 10% commission
3. Remaining 90% enters seller's pending balance with 14-day hold period start date
4. Seller ships product and updates order status
5. Buyer receives product and confirms delivery
6. 14-day hold period elapses without dispute
7. Funds move from pending balance to available balance
8. On biweekly payout date (1st and 15th of month), platform initiates payout batch
9. Seller receives bank transfer within 2-3 business days
10. Seller dashboard reflects updated balances

**Stakeholders:** Buyers (purchasers), Sellers (product vendors), Platform (commission collector), Banking/Payment Processors (payout facilitators)

---

### Process 3: Dispute Resolution

**Current State:** E-commerce disputes often lack transparency, formal mediation, or clear escalation paths, leading to frustration on both buyer and seller sides.

**Future State:** Structured three-phase dispute resolution: buyer claim, mediation period (3 days), administrator escalation with final decision authority.

**Process Flow:**
1. Buyer identifies issue with received order (damaged, not as described, never arrived)
2. Buyer opens dispute within 7-day window from delivery, providing evidence
3. Seller receives dispute notification and reviews claim
4. Mediation period begins (3 days) with messaging interface for buyer-seller communication
5. Parties attempt to reach mutual agreement (refund, replacement, no action)
6. If agreement reached: Platform executes resolution and closes dispute
7. If mediation fails: Dispute auto-escalates to administrator queue
8. Administrator reviews evidence, policies, and party histories
9. Administrator renders final decision with reasoning
10. Platform executes decision (refund if applicable) and notifies both parties
11. Dispute closed with recorded outcome

**Stakeholders:** Buyers (claimants), Sellers (respondents), Platform Administrators (mediators and arbiters)

---

## 11. Assumptions and Constraints

### Assumptions

1. **Market Demand:** Sufficient demand exists for regionally-focused artisan marketplace in Southeast Asia to support 500 sellers within 12 months
2. **Seller Availability:** Artisan sellers are willing to undergo manual verification process and accept 10% commission rate
3. **Payment Gateway Availability:** Stripe and local payment gateway providers (for SGD, MYR, THB) support required multi-currency and cross-border transaction capabilities
4. **Shipping Carrier Integrations:** J&T Express, Ninja Van, DHL, and FedEx provide API access for rate quotes, label generation, and tracking for platform integration
5. **Administrator Capacity:** Platform can staff sufficient administrators to meet 48-hour seller verification SLA and handle dispute escalations as volume grows
6. **Regulatory Compliance:** Platform can achieve compliance with e-commerce, data protection, and consumer protection regulations across operating countries without prohibitive cost or delay
7. **Technology Infrastructure:** Platform can be built on scalable technology stack supporting multi-currency, multi-language, and high-volume transaction processing
8. **Buyer Trust:** Manual seller verification and transparent review system will be sufficient to build buyer trust without additional trust signals (e.g., buyer protection guarantees, insurance)

---

### Constraints

1. **Manual Verification Bottleneck:** 48-hour seller verification SLA limits seller onboarding velocity; administrator capacity must scale with application volume
2. **Multi-Currency Exchange Rate Dependency:** Real-time currency conversion relies on external exchange rate API availability and accuracy; outages or inaccuracies impact pricing transparency
3. **Shipping Carrier Coverage:** Platform's shipping capabilities are limited to carriers with API integrations (J&T, Ninja Van, DHL, FedEx); sellers requiring alternative carriers must handle shipping independently
4. **Dispute Hold Period Cash Flow Impact:** 14-day fund hold period delays seller payouts, which may deter sellers with tight cash flow needs
5. **Commission Rate Competitiveness:** 10% commission must remain competitive with alternative platforms (e.g., Etsy charges 6.5% + payment processing fees) to attract and retain sellers
6. **Language Localization Scope:** User interface supports English, Malay, and Thai only; product descriptions and reviews remain in seller's original language (not auto-translated)
7. **Geographic Scope:** Platform focuses on Southeast Asia initially; expansion to additional regions requires additional payment gateway, shipping carrier, and regulatory compliance investments
8. **Content Moderation Scalability:** Manual content moderation for prohibited items and quality flags may become bottleneck as product listings scale beyond initial hundreds to thousands

---

## 12. Risks and Mitigation Strategies

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|------------|---------------------|
| **Slow Seller Adoption:** Artisan sellers hesitate to join due to 10% commission rate or manual verification requirements | High - Platform cannot achieve 500 seller target, limiting product variety and buyer attraction | Medium | **Mitigation:** Conduct seller interviews during beta to validate commission acceptability; offer promotional incentives for early adopters (reduced commission for first 3 months); streamline verification process to minimize onboarding friction; provide seller success resources (listing optimization guides, marketing tools) |
| **Payment Gateway Integration Failures:** Stripe or local gateways experience outages or API changes breaking payment processing | Critical - Buyers cannot complete purchases, direct revenue loss | Low | **Mitigation:** Implement fallback payment methods (multiple gateway integrations); monitor gateway uptime with real-time alerts; maintain communication channel with gateway technical support; test payment flows in staging environment before production deployments |
| **Dispute Volume Exceeds Capacity:** Higher-than-expected dispute rate (>5% target) overwhelms administrator dispute resolution capacity | High - Slow dispute resolution damages buyer and seller trust, increases churn | Medium | **Mitigation:** Implement automated mediation guidance templates to streamline early resolution; hire and train additional dispute resolution administrators proactively based on transaction volume growth; analyze dispute patterns to identify root causes (e.g., specific seller quality issues, unclear product descriptions) and address proactively |
| **Counterfeit or Prohibited Items Slip Through:** Sellers list counterfeit goods or prohibited items (weapons, illegal substances) that evade content moderation | Critical - Legal liability, brand reputation damage, regulatory penalties | Medium | **Mitigation:** Implement automated keyword and image detection for prohibited content; require human administrator review for flagged listings before going live; establish IP rights holder reporting mechanism with rapid takedown process; suspend repeat offenders immediately; maintain audit log of content moderation decisions |
| **Currency Exchange Rate Volatility:** Rapid currency fluctuations cause pricing discrepancies or buyer confusion | Medium - Buyer trust issues if displayed prices differ significantly from charged amount | Medium | **Mitigation:** Refresh exchange rates frequently (hourly); display exchange rate timestamp and disclaimer at checkout; charge buyers in seller's base currency to avoid double conversion; consider implementing dynamic pricing alerts if rates change >5% in 24 hours |
| **Shipping Carrier Delays or Failures:** Carrier fails to deliver on time, loses packages, or provides inaccurate tracking | High - Buyer dissatisfaction, increased dispute rate, seller reputation damage | High (shipping is inherently risky) | **Mitigation:** Integrate with multiple carriers to provide alternatives; display realistic delivery estimates based on carrier SLA data; implement automated tracking updates and delay notifications to buyers; establish seller guidelines for proper packaging and accurate weight/dimensions; provide shipping insurance options for high-value items |
| **Regulatory Compliance Violations:** Platform inadvertently violates data protection, consumer protection, or tax regulations in operating countries | Critical - Legal penalties, forced operational changes, reputation damage | Low (with proper legal review) | **Mitigation:** Engage legal counsel with expertise in Southeast Asian e-commerce regulations during design phase; conduct compliance audits quarterly; implement data protection by design (encryption, access controls, retention policies); maintain compliance documentation and audit trails; monitor regulatory changes in operating countries |
| **Fraudulent Seller or Buyer Activity:** Bad actors exploit platform for money laundering, stolen goods sales, or fraudulent chargebacks | High - Financial loss, legal liability, platform reputation damage | Medium | **Mitigation:** Implement robust KYC verification for sellers (government ID, business registration); monitor transaction patterns for anomalies (automated fraud detection rules); limit payout velocity for new sellers (graduated payout schedule); require chargeback dispute evidence from sellers; suspend accounts with multiple fraud flags pending investigation |
| **Technology Scalability Issues:** Platform infrastructure cannot handle growth to 500 sellers and corresponding buyer traffic | High - Site outages, slow page loads, transaction failures leading to revenue loss and churn | Medium | **Mitigation:** Design platform on cloud infrastructure with auto-scaling capabilities (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure); conduct load testing before launch and at growth milestones; implement caching for high-traffic pages (homepage, category pages); monitor performance metrics (page load time, API response time) with alerts for degradation; plan infrastructure capacity proactively based on growth projections |
| **Recommendation Engine Poor Performance:** Personalized recommendations are irrelevant or biased, failing to improve conversion | Low - Nice-to-have feature underperforms, but core marketplace functions remain | Medium | **Mitigation:** Start with simpler recommendation algorithms (category-based, trending products) rather than complex ML models; A/B test recommendation strategies to validate effectiveness; collect user feedback on recommendation relevance; iterate algorithm based on conversion data; consider third-party recommendation engine if in-house development underperforms |
