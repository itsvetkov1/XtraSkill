## Domain Definitions
- **PII (Personally Identifiable Information):** Data that can be used to identify an individual, including but not limited to names, emails, phone numbers, SSNs, and account numbers.
- **Confidence Score:** A numerical percentage (0-100%) indicating the system's certainty that an extracted item is accurate and categorized correctly.
- **Noise Filtering:** The automated removal of non-business related conversation (e.g., small talk, technical interruptions, pleasantries) from the final requirement set.
- **Categorized Draft:** A structured output grouping information into: Requirements, Action Items, Decisions Made, Open Questions, and Stakeholder Concerns.
- **Project Memory:** The cumulative context of all past transcripts and documentation linked to a specific project entity.

## User Stories

### US-01: Multi-Source Transcript Import
**As a Consulting BA,** I want to upload meeting recordings or transcript files from various sources (Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Otter.ai), **so that** I can process discovery sessions regardless of the client's preferred meeting platform.

- **Priority:** P0 | **Complexity:** L
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. System accepts file uploads in .txt, .vtt, .srt, and .docx formats.
  2. System processes transcripts from recordings up to the configured maximum duration (default: 180 minutes) without loss of conversation context.
  3. System parses speaker labels from the source file and maps them to distinct speaker entities in the analysis interface within 30 seconds of upload.
  4. **Exception Handling:** If the file format is unsupported, the system notifies the BA and provides a list of valid formats.
  5. **Exception Handling:** If the file is corrupted or unreadable, the system informs the BA that the upload failed and suggests a re-export from the source tool.

### US-02: Automated PII Detection & Redaction
**As a Junior BA,** I want the system to automatically flag and mask sensitive PII within a transcript, **so that** I can ensure compliance with HIPAA and GDPR before the data is analyzed or stored.

- **Priority:** P0 | **Complexity:** L
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. System identifies at least 95% of standard PII patterns (names, emails, phone numbers, SSNs, account numbers) using the configured detection sensitivity.
  2. System provides a review interface where the Junior BA must confirm, modify, or ignore each flagged item before analysis can proceed.
  3. All data transmitted for redaction review must be encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher.
  4. **Exception Handling:** If no PII is detected, the system requires an explicit "No PII Found - Proceed" confirmation from the BA.
  5. **Exception Handling:** If the auto-redaction service is unavailable, the system prevents further processing and logs a high-priority incident in the audit trail.
- **Depends on:** US-01

### US-03: Categorized AI Requirement Extraction
**As a Junior BA,** I want the system to generate a structured first draft of the meeting findings, **so that** I can reduce my initial documentation time by at least 60%.

- **Priority:** P0 | **Complexity:** XL
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. System generates a draft containing five mandatory sections: Requirements, Action Items, Decisions Made, Open Questions, and Stakeholder Concerns.
  2. Extraction must utilize noise filtering to exclude at least 90% of non-business conversational chatter (e.g., weather talk, lunch plans).
  3. Every extracted item must be attributed to a specific speaker identified in the transcript.
  4. **Exception Handling:** If the transcript is too short (less than 50 words), the system notifies the BA that there is insufficient data for a structured draft.
  5. **Exception Handling:** If the extraction engine fails to categorize an item, it places the item in a "Uncategorized" section for manual BA review.
- **Depends on:** US-02

### US-04: Confidence Scoring and Validation
**As a Senior BA,** I want to see a confidence score for every AI-extracted item, **so that** I can focus my review efforts on the most ambiguous or high-risk requirements.

- **Priority:** P1 | **Complexity:** M
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. System displays a percentage-based confidence score (0-100%) for every requirement, action item, and decision.
  2. Items with a confidence score below the configured "Low Confidence Threshold" (default: 70%) are visually highlighted for immediate attention.
  3. Any manual edit by the BA to an extracted item results in the score being replaced by a "Verified" status.
  4. **Exception Handling:** If a confidence score cannot be calculated, the system defaults to "Needs Manual Review."
  5. **Exception Handling:** If a BA rejects more than 50% of items in a single section, the system triggers a request for the user to provide feedback on extraction quality.
- **Depends on:** US-03

### US-05: Contextual Follow-up Chat
**As a Junior BA,** I want to ask natural language questions about the transcript context, **so that** I can clarify specific stakeholder statements or edge cases without re-reading the entire document.

- **Priority:** P1 | **Complexity:** M
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. System provides answers to user queries within 5 seconds, referencing only the content of the current transcript.
  2. Every answer provided by the chat must include a direct citation/link to the specific line number or timestamp in the source transcript.
  3. The chat must maintain history for the duration of the project session to support multi-turn inquiries.
  4. **Exception Handling:** If a query refers to information not present in the transcript, the system must state "Information not found in this meeting" rather than hallucinating an answer.
  5. **Exception Handling:** If the query violates safety or privacy guidelines, the system refuses the request and logs the attempt.
- **Depends on:** US-03

### US-06: Project Memory Integration
**As a Project Manager,** I want the analyzed transcript and extracted items to be linked to the Project History, **so that** future AI analysis can account for previously made decisions and requirements.

- **Priority:** P1 | **Complexity:** S
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Once finalized, the transcript and its extracted metadata are indexed as part of the "Project Context" within 60 seconds.
  2. Future discovery sessions for the same project must reference these historical decisions when the BA uses the contextual chat.
  3. Users must be able to filter project requirements by the specific meeting date or transcript source.
  4. **Exception Handling:** If a project link is broken, the system prevents the upload until a valid project entity is selected.
  5. **Exception Handling:** If conflicting decisions are found between the new transcript and historical data, the system flags a "Potential Conflict" for the Project Manager.

### US-07: Compliance Audit Logging
**As a Compliance Officer,** I want a full audit trail of all transcript interactions, **so that** we can demonstrate adherence to healthcare and financial data regulations.

- **Priority:** P0 | **Complexity:** S
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. System logs the timestamp, User ID, and action for every upload, redaction confirmation, and extraction export.
  2. Audit logs are stored in a read-only format and retained for the configured retention period (default: 7 years).
  3. Any attempt to access a transcript without appropriate permissions results in an immediate alert to the system administrator.
  4. **Exception Handling:** If the logging service is down, all transcript processing must be suspended to prevent un-audited actions.
  5. **Exception Handling:** If a log reaches its storage limit, the system must trigger an archive process rather than overwriting existing logs.

## Dependency Summary
- **Critical Path:** US-01 -> US-02 -> US-03 -> US-04
- **Secondary Features:** US-05 and US-06 require the baseline extraction from US-03.
- **Compliance:** US-07 is an overarching requirement that applies to all data handling stories.
