</details>

<details>
<summary>✅ v0.1-claude-code: Claude Code as AI Backend (Phases 57-61) — SHIPPED 2026-02-17</summary>

**Milestone Goal:** Determine if Claude Code's agent capabilities (via Python SDK or CLI subprocess) produce measurably better business analysis artifacts than the current direct API approach, and if so, build a production-viable adapter.

**Outcome:** Experiment successful — CLI adapter adopted. Formal quality comparison skipped; user decided to ship based on implementation experience and CLI BRD quality.

**Branch:** `feature/claude-code-backend` → merged to master

- [x] Phase 57: Foundation (2/2 plans) — completed 2026-02-13
- [x] Phase 58: Agent SDK Adapter (2/2 plans) — completed 2026-02-14
- [x] Phase 59: CLI Subprocess Adapter (2/2 plans) — completed 2026-02-14
- [x] Phase 60: Frontend Integration (2/2 plans) — completed 2026-02-15
- [x] Phase 61: Quality Comparison & Decision (3/4 plans, 1 skipped) — completed 2026-02-17

</details>

<details>
<summary>✅ v3.0 Assistant Foundation (Phases 62-64) — SHIPPED 2026-02-18</summary>

- [x] Phase 62: Backend Foundation (3/3 plans) — completed 2026-02-17
- [x] Phase 63: Navigation & Thread Management (2/2 plans) — completed 2026-02-17
- [x] Phase 64: Conversation & Documents (5/5 plans) — completed 2026-02-18

</details>

<details>
<summary>✅ v3.1 Skill Discovery & Selection (Phases 65-67) — SHIPPED 2026-02-18</summary>

**Milestone Goal:** Enhance the Assistant skill selector into a browsable list with descriptions, info popups, and transparent skill prepending.

- [x] Phase 65: Backend Skill Metadata (2/2 plans) — completed 2026-02-18
- [x] Phase 66: Skill Browser UI (2/2 plans) — completed 2026-02-18
- [x] Phase 67: Skill Info Popup (1/1 plans) — completed 2026-02-18

Full details: `.planning/milestones/v3.1-ROADMAP.md`

</details>

### ✅ v3.1.1 Assistant Conversation Memory (SHIPPED 2026-02-20)

**Milestone Goal:** Fix the critical bug where the Assistant loses conversation context after 2-3 messages, add token optimization to prevent context window overflow, and baseline subprocess performance.

- [x] **Phase 68: Core Conversation Memory Fix** - Replace single-message prompting with full history formatting, validate with tests (completed 2026-02-19)
- [x] **Phase 69: Token Optimization** - Filter tool_use blocks and ensure linear token growth across long conversations (completed 2026-02-20)
- [x] **Phase 70: Performance Tuning** - asyncio.Queue pre-warming pool reduces spawn latency from ~120-400ms cold to <5ms warm (completed 2026-02-20)

## Phase Details

### Phase 68: Core Conversation Memory Fix
**Goal**: Assistant conversations preserve full context across all turns
**Depends on**: Phase 67 (v3.1 complete)
**Requirements**: CONV-01, CONV-02, CONV-03, CONV-04, TEST-01, TEST-02, TEST-03, TEST-04, TEST-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can have a 5+ turn conversation in Assistant mode where the AI correctly references information from earlier turns
  2. Each message sent to the CLI subprocess includes the full conversation history with clear role labels
  3. BA Assistant flow continues to work identically (no regression from CLI adapter changes)
  4. Backend and frontend test suites pass with new conversation memory tests
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 68-01-PLAN.md — Backend fix: replace single-message prompt with multi-turn formatter + unit tests + integration test
- [ ] 68-02-PLAN.md — Frontend tests: AssistantConversationProvider unit test coverage

### Phase 69: Token Optimization
**Goal**: Long Assistant conversations with document context stay within token limits without degrading quality
**Depends on**: Phase 68
**Requirements**: TOKEN-01, TOKEN-02, TOKEN-03, TOKEN-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A 20+ turn conversation with document searches shows linear (not quadratic) token growth
  2. Assistant messages sent to CLI have tool_use blocks stripped, keeping only human-readable text
  3. Conversations exceeding 180K tokens show a clear error message instead of a silent failure
  4. Existing 150K truncation limit continues to function correctly for the CLI adapter
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [ ] 69-01-PLAN.md — 180K emergency token limit + TOKEN-01/02/03/04 verification tests

### Phase 70: Performance Tuning
**Goal**: Subprocess spawn overhead is measured, documented, and reduced through process pooling
**Depends on**: Phase 68
**Requirements**: PERF-01, PERF-02, PERF-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Subprocess spawn latency is measured and recorded as a baseline (expected ~400ms)
  2. Process pooling reuses warm subprocesses instead of cold-starting each message
  3. Measured latency improvement is documented (target: under 200ms with warm pool)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 70-01-PLAN.md — Process pool implementation + FastAPI lifespan integration + latency measurement + unit tests
