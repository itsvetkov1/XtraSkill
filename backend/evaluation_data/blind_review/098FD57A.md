I cannot generate a Business Requirements Document because we have not had a requirements discovery discussion.

**Here's what actually happened in this conversation:**

1. You stated: "We're building an e-commerce marketplace platform where sellers can list products, buyers can purchase, and administrators manage the overall platform."

2. I asked you to select Meeting Mode or Document Refinement Mode (3 times)

3. You asked six feature questions without answering my mode selection request

4. You now want me to generate a BRD

**What's missing:** We have conducted ZERO requirements discovery. I don't know:
- Your business objectives
- Why you're building this marketplace
- Who your target sellers and buyers are
- What problems you're solving
- What success looks like
- Your constraints, regulations, or competitive context
- Any actual requirements beyond "sellers list, buyers purchase, admins manage"

**To generate a meaningful BRD, I need to conduct discovery first. Here's what I propose:**

I will switch us into **Meeting Mode** and ask you systematic discovery questions (one at a time). After gathering sufficient information about your business context, objectives, users, and requirements, I will then generate a comprehensive BRD.

**Are you willing to answer discovery questions so I can create a quality BRD?**

Type **"Yes, let's start discovery"** and I'll ask my first question, or tell me if you prefer a different approach.
