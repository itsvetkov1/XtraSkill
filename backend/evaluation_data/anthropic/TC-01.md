I appreciate your request, but before I can generate a comprehensive Business Requirements Document, I need to gather essential business context through discovery. 

Right now, our conversation has touched on **features you're considering** (email/password login, password reset, social login), but I'm missing **critical business information** that must be in any quality BRD:

**What's missing:**
- **Primary business objective** - Why are you building this login feature? What business problem does it solve?
- **Target user personas** - Who will use this? What are their characteristics, technical proficiency, pain points?
- **Business context** - What's your industry? Are there compliance requirements (healthcare, finance, education)?
- **Success metrics** - How will you measure if this authentication feature is successful?
- **Key user flows** - Beyond just login, what happens after? What triggers the need to log in?
- **Stakeholder needs** - Who cares about this feature beyond end users?
- **Current state challenges** - What's broken today that this solves?

**Here's what I recommend:**

Let me guide you through systematic discovery (Meeting Mode) with targeted questions - this typically takes 10-15 questions and ensures we capture everything needed for a production-ready BRD that your technical team can actually use for architecture and estimation.

**Are you ready to go through discovery with me?** 

If yes, I'll start with the most important question. If you're short on time and want me to generate a BRD based only on the limited information we have so far, I can do that - but it will contain many assumptions that you'll need to validate before using it with your technical team or customers.

Which would you prefer: **(A) Go through systematic discovery now, or (B) Generate BRD with current limited information and many assumptions?**
