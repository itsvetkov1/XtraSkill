# Requirements: Business Analyst Assistant v1.6

**Defined:** 2026-01-30
**Core Value:** Reduce friction in the core conversation workflow — users can recover from errors, copy content easily, organize threads, and identify their account.

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for v1.6 UX Quick Wins release. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Error Recovery

- [x] **RETRY-01**: Error banner shows "Dismiss | Retry" actions when AI request fails
- [x] **RETRY-02**: Retry resends the last user message without retyping
- [x] **RETRY-03**: Failed message state tracked in ConversationProvider
- [x] **RETRY-04**: Works for both network errors and API errors

### Content Copying

- [x] **COPY-01**: Copy icon button visible on all assistant messages
- [x] **COPY-02**: Copy action copies full message content to clipboard
- [x] **COPY-03**: Snackbar confirms "Copied to clipboard"
- [x] **COPY-04**: Copy works cross-platform (web, Android, iOS) with error handling

### Thread Management

- [x] **THREAD-01**: Edit icon in ConversationScreen AppBar opens rename dialog
- [x] **THREAD-02**: "Rename" option in Thread List PopupMenu
- [x] **THREAD-03**: Dialog pre-fills current thread title
- [x] **THREAD-04**: Backend PATCH endpoint for thread rename

### Settings Enhancement

- [x] **SETTINGS-01**: Auth provider indicator shown in Settings profile section
- [x] **SETTINGS-02**: Display format: "Signed in with Google" or "Signed in with Microsoft"

## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Error Recovery Enhancements

- **RETRY-05**: Partial response preserved on network interruption during streaming
- **RETRY-06**: "Regenerate" option for alternative AI response

### Content Copying Enhancements

- **COPY-05**: Long-press menu includes "Copy" option alongside Delete
- **COPY-06**: Copy code blocks individually (separate from full message)

### Thread Management Enhancements

- **THREAD-05**: Inline rename (tap title to edit without dialog)
- **THREAD-06**: Thread list search and filter

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Brand icons for OAuth providers | Adds package dependency (font_awesome_flutter ~2MB), text indicator sufficient |
| Inline thread rename | Dialog pattern matches existing codebase (ThreadCreateDialog), simpler to maintain |
| Long-press copy menu | One-tap copy button provides sufficient convenience |
| Retry with regenerate option | Simple resend is MVP; regenerate adds AI cost implications |
| Partial streaming response preservation | Complex state management; deferred to v2 |
