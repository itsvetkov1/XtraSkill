---

## Document Metadata

- **Version:** 1.0 Draft
- **Author:** Generated by BA Assistant
- **Date:** 2026-02-16
- **Status:** Draft — Pending Review
- **Project:** Patient Portal for Multi-Specialty Medical Group
- **Scope:** HIPAA-compliant patient portal enabling medical record access, appointment scheduling, and secure provider communication, integrated with existing Epic EHR system

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This Business Requirements Document outlines the requirements for a HIPAA-compliant patient portal system for a multi-specialty medical group serving approximately 15,000 active patients across 3 office locations with 12 physicians and 8 nurse practitioners. The portal will replace current manual processes (phone-based appointment scheduling and paper statements) with digital self-service capabilities including medical record access, appointment scheduling, and secure provider messaging.

The primary business objective is to reduce administrative overhead on clinical and office staff by enabling patient self-service while improving patient satisfaction through convenient 24/7 access to health information and care team communication. The system must integrate with the organization's existing Epic EHR system and comply with all HIPAA security and privacy requirements.

The portal will serve three primary user groups: patients (self-service access to records and scheduling), clinical providers (secure messaging and record access), and office staff (administrative functions and identity verification). Given the small IT team (2 personnel), the solution must prioritize maintainability and minimize ongoing technical support burden.

## 2. Business Context

### Current State Challenges

The medical group currently operates with manual, phone-based processes that create several operational inefficiencies:

- **Appointment Scheduling Burden:** Patients must call during business hours to schedule appointments, consuming significant office staff time and creating barriers for patients with scheduling constraints
- **Limited Medical Record Access:** Patients receive paper statements via mail, with no self-service access to lab results, medication lists, or visit summaries
- **Communication Inefficiencies:** All patient-provider communication occurs via phone calls, creating interruptions to clinical workflows and lacking documentation integration with medical records
- **Administrative Overhead:** Manual processes for appointment scheduling, record requests, and patient communication consume clinical and administrative staff resources that could be redirected to patient care

### Market and Regulatory Drivers

- **Patient Expectations:** Healthcare consumers increasingly expect digital self-service capabilities similar to other service industries (banking, retail), including 24/7 access to personal health information
- **HIPAA Compliance Mandate:** All patient health information (PHI) handling must comply with HIPAA Security Rule and Privacy Rule requirements, including encryption, access controls, audit logging, and Business Associate Agreements
- **Regulatory Push for Patient Access:** Federal regulations (21st Century Cures Act) require timely patient access to electronic health information
- **Operational Efficiency Goals:** Reducing manual administrative work enables staff reallocation to higher-value patient care activities

### Strategic Alignment

The patient portal aligns with the organization's strategic goals of:

- Improving patient satisfaction and engagement through convenient digital access
- Reducing operational costs by automating routine administrative tasks
- Maintaining regulatory compliance with evolving healthcare data access requirements
- Enhancing care coordination through documented secure messaging integrated with medical records

## 6. Functional Requirements

Requirements are organized by priority classification:

- **P0 (Must-Have):** Essential for initial launch; system is not viable without these
- **P1 (Should-Have):** Important for business value; deliver in initial launch if feasible, defer to Phase 2 if necessary
- **P2 (Nice-to-Have):** Valuable enhancements; can be deferred to future releases

---

### P0: Must-Have Requirements

#### FR-001: HIPAA-Compliant Data Encryption

**Description:** All patient health information (PHI) must be encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms both when stored (at rest) and during transmission (in transit) to comply with HIPAA Security Rule requirements.

**Business Rationale:** HIPAA compliance is a legal requirement; non-compliance results in severe financial penalties and legal liability. Encryption protects patient privacy and organizational reputation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The system SHALL encrypt all PHI at rest using AES-256 encryption algorithm
- The system SHALL encrypt all data in transit using TLS 1.2 or higher protocol
- The system SHALL store encryption keys separately from encrypted data using a dedicated key management service
- The system SHALL rotate encryption keys at least annually with zero downtime for users
- The system SHALL fail closed (deny access) if encryption verification fails, rather than exposing unencrypted data
- The system SHALL log all encryption failures with timestamp, affected data identifier, and failure reason to security audit log

**Error/Exception Scenarios:**

- **Encryption Failure:** If data encryption fails during write operation, the system SHALL reject the write operation, return error code to user indicating temporary system unavailability, alert IT staff via email with failure details, and log incident to security audit log
- **TLS Handshake Failure:** If client connection cannot establish TLS 1.2+ connection, the system SHALL reject connection attempt, display message to user: "Your browser does not support required security protocols. Please update your browser and try again," and log attempted connection source IP and browser version for security review

---

#### FR-002: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Description:** The system must enforce role-based access control ensuring users can only access data and functionality appropriate to their role: patients view only their own records, providers view only their assigned patients (plus emergency access), and office staff have administrative access.

**Business Rationale:** HIPAA requires minimum necessary access controls; inappropriate access creates compliance violations, legal liability, and patient privacy breaches.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The system SHALL define at least three distinct user roles: Patient, Provider, and Office Staff, each with explicitly configured permissions
- The system SHALL restrict patients to view only their own medical record number (MRN) data with zero access to other patients' PHI
- The system SHALL restrict providers to view only patients on their assigned care panel, plus emergency override access with documented justification
- The system SHALL grant office staff administrative access to patient registration, identity verification, and appointment scheduling functions, but restrict access to clinical notes unless clinically credentialed
- The system SHALL deny access attempts outside role permissions and log denied access attempts with user identifier, attempted resource, timestamp, and denial reason to security audit log
- The system SHALL require administrative approval workflow to change user role assignments, with approval logged to audit trail

**Error/Exception Scenarios:**

- **Unauthorized Access Attempt:** If user attempts to access resource outside their role permissions, the system SHALL deny access, display message "You do not have permission to access this information," log unauthorized access attempt with full context (user ID, resource, timestamp) to security audit log, and alert Compliance Officer if pattern of repeated unauthorized access attempts detected (>3 attempts within 24 hours by same user)
- **Role Assignment Conflict:** If user is assigned to multiple conflicting roles (e.g., both Patient and Provider), the system SHALL prevent login, display message "Your account has a configuration error. Please contact the office for assistance," alert IT staff via email with account details, and log incident to system error log

---

#### FR-003: Comprehensive Audit Logging

**Description:** The system must log every access, modification, or deletion of patient health information (PHI) with sufficient detail to support HIPAA compliance audits and breach investigations.

**Business Rationale:** HIPAA requires audit controls and access logs; comprehensive logging is essential for compliance audits, breach investigations, and detecting unauthorized access patterns.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The system SHALL log every PHI access event with minimum fields: user identifier, user role, patient MRN, data element accessed (e.g., "Lab Results", "Medication List"), timestamp (UTC), source IP address, and session identifier
- The system SHALL log every PHI modification event with minimum fields: user identifier, patient MRN, data element modified, old value, new value, timestamp (UTC), and modification reason if provided
- The system SHALL retain audit logs for minimum 7 years in tamper-proof storage (write-once-read-many or equivalent)
- The system SHALL provide audit log export functionality for Compliance Officer role, allowing filtering by date range, user, patient MRN, and event type
- The system SHALL generate weekly automated audit log summary reports delivered to Compliance Officer via secure email, highlighting: total access events, failed login attempts, emergency access overrides, and any detected anomalies
- The system SHALL protect audit logs from modification or deletion by any user including administrators (immutable logs)

**Error/Exception Scenarios:**

- **Audit Log Write Failure:** If audit log write operation fails (e.g., disk full, service unavailable), the system SHALL deny the user action that triggered the log event, display message "System temporarily unavailable - please try again shortly," alert IT staff via email and SMS with failure details, and queue failed audit event for retry once logging service is restored
- **Audit Log Tampering Detection:** If audit log integrity check detects tampering or modification, the system SHALL immediately alert Compliance Officer and IT Director via email and SMS with affected log details, lock affected user accounts pending investigation, and generate incident report for HIPAA breach assessment

---

#### FR-004: Epic EHR Integration for Medical Records

**Description:** The system must integrate with the organization's existing Epic EHR system to retrieve and display patient medical records including lab results, medication lists, immunization records, and visit summaries.

**Business Rationale:** The organization has invested significantly in Epic EHR as the source of truth for clinical data; duplicating this data would create synchronization issues, data integrity problems, and excessive cost.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The system SHALL integrate with Epic EHR using Epic's standard FHIR API or proprietary integration methods recommended by Epic
- The system SHALL retrieve and display the following data elements from Epic in real-time (not cached copies): lab results with test names/values/reference ranges, active medication list with dosage/frequency, immunization records with vaccine type/date/lot number, and visit summaries with date/provider/diagnosis
- The system SHALL synchronize patient demographic updates from Epic at least every 4 hours, ensuring patient name, date of birth, contact information, and assigned care panel reflect current Epic data
- The system SHALL display provider-reviewed lab results within the configured release timeframe (default: immediately after provider signs off in Epic)
- The system SHALL hide pending/draft clinical documentation that has not been finalized by provider (e.g., unsigned visit notes, preliminary lab results not yet reviewed)
- The system SHALL handle Epic API unavailability gracefully by displaying cached data (if available from previous successful sync within 24 hours) with clear timestamp indicating data freshness, or displaying message "Medical records temporarily unavailable - please try again shortly" if no recent cache available

**Error/Exception Scenarios:**

- **Epic API Failure:** If Epic FHIR API returns error or timeout (>10 seconds), the system SHALL display cached medical record data (if cache exists and is <24 hours old) with prominent banner: "Displaying records as of [timestamp]. Live data temporarily unavailable," log API failure details to system error log, and alert IT staff via email if failure persists >15 minutes
- **Patient Record Not Found in Epic:** If patient attempts to access medical records but their MRN is not found in Epic (e.g., data synchronization issue), the system SHALL display message "Your medical records are temporarily unavailable. Please contact the office at [phone number] for assistance," log data sync error with patient MRN and Epic query details, and alert IT staff via email for investigation

---

#### FR-005: Self-Service Appointment Scheduling

**Description:** Patients must be able to schedule, view, and cancel appointments through the portal by selecting appointment type, preferred provider, office location, and available time slots.

**Business Rationale:** Self-service scheduling reduces office staff phone call volume by enabling patients to schedule at their convenience (evenings/weekends), improving patient satisfaction while decreasing administrative overhead.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The system SHALL display appointment types configured by office staff (e.g., "Annual Physical", "Follow-Up Visit", "New Patient Consultation") with estimated duration for each type
- The system SHALL allow patients to select preferred provider from list of providers in selected specialty, or select "No Preference" to view all available slots across providers
- The system SHALL allow patients to select preferred office location (3 locations) or "Any Location" to view slots across all locations
- The system SHALL display available appointment slots for next 60 days based on provider calendar availability synchronized from Epic scheduling system in real-time
- The system SHALL allow patients to select desired date/time slot, confirm appointment details, and receive immediate confirmation message with appointment date/time/location/provider displayed on screen and sent via email
- The system SHALL allow patients to cancel scheduled appointments with at least 24 hours notice, releasing the slot for other patients to book
- The system SHALL warn patients attempting to cancel with <24 hours notice about cancellation policy and require confirmation: "Appointments must be cancelled at least 24 hours in advance. Late cancellations may result in a fee. Do you wish to proceed?"

**Error/Exception Scenarios:**

- **Appointment Slot No Longer Available:** If patient selects slot but another patient books it concurrently (race condition), the system SHALL display message "This appointment time is no longer available. Please select another time," refresh available slots display with currently available options, and log concurrency event for system monitoring
- **Provider Calendar Sync Failure:** If Epic scheduling API is unavailable or fails to return provider availability, the system SHALL display message "Appointment scheduling temporarily unavailable. Please call [office number] to schedule or try again shortly," log API failure details to system error log, and alert IT staff via email if failure persists >15 minutes

---

#### FR-006: Automated Appointment Reminders

**Description:** The system must send automated appointment reminders to patients via email and SMS at configured intervals before scheduled appointments to reduce no-show rates.

**Business Rationale:** Appointment no-shows waste provider time and reduce practice revenue; automated reminders have been proven to reduce no-show rates by 20-30% in similar practices.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The system SHALL send email appointment reminder to patient's registered email address at 7 days before scheduled appointment with appointment date/time/provider/location/appointment type
- The system SHALL send email appointment reminder to patient's registered email address at 1 day before scheduled appointment with same details as 7-day reminder
- The system SHALL send SMS appointment reminder to patient's registered mobile phone number at 1 day before scheduled appointment with abbreviated message: "[Practice Name] Reminder: You have an appointment on [date] at [time] with [provider]. Reply CANCEL to cancel or call [phone]"
- The system SHALL include confirmation link in email reminders allowing patient to confirm attendance or cancel appointment directly from email
- The system SHALL retry failed reminder deliveries (e.g., email bounce, SMS delivery failure) once after 1 hour, then log delivery failure with patient contact info to administrative alert queue for office staff follow-up
- The system SHALL respect patient communication preferences configured in portal settings (e.g., "Email only", "SMS only", "Both", "No reminders")

**Error/Exception Scenarios:**

- **Email Delivery Failure:** If email reminder fails to deliver (hard bounce, invalid address), the system SHALL log delivery failure with patient MRN and email address to administrative alert queue, attempt SMS reminder as fallback (if mobile number on file), and alert office staff via daily summary report of failed reminder deliveries for manual follow-up
- **SMS Delivery Failure:** If SMS reminder fails to deliver (invalid number, carrier error), the system SHALL log delivery failure with patient MRN and phone number, and alert office staff via daily summary report for manual follow-up (office staff may call patient directly)

---

#### FR-007: Secure Messaging with Care Team

**Description:** Patients must be able to send secure messages to their care team (providers, nurses) through the portal, receive responses within defined service levels, and have all message threads automatically documented in the medical record.

**Business Rationale:** Secure messaging reduces phone call interruptions to clinical staff, enables asynchronous communication convenient for both patients and providers, and automatically documents all clinical communication in the medical record for continuity of care.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The system SHALL allow patients to compose new messages with subject line (maximum 100 characters), message body (maximum 2000 characters), and urgency selection: "Routine" (24-hour response target) or "Urgent" (4-hour response target)
- The system SHALL route new patient messages to care team message queue viewable by nursing staff and assigned providers
- The system SHALL send real-time notification to assigned nursing staff when new message is received, with urgent messages triggering immediate email and SMS alerts to on-call provider
- The system SHALL allow nursing staff and providers to reply to patient messages, with replies automatically threading under original message and sending email notification to patient that response is available
- The system SHALL automatically export complete message threads (patient message + all provider responses) to patient's medical record in Epic EHR within 5 minutes of each message sent/received
- The system SHALL display response time targets to patients when composing messages: "Routine messages receive response within 24 hours (business days). Urgent messages receive response within 4 hours (business days M-F 8 AM - 5 PM). For medical emergencies, call 911 or go to emergency department."
- The system SHALL display message status to patients: "Sent" (delivered to care team), "Read" (opened by care team), "Responded" (reply sent) with timestamp of each status change

**Error/Exception Scenarios:**

- **Message Export to Epic Fails:** If automatic export of message thread to Epic EHR fails (API error, network timeout), the system SHALL retry export every 15 minutes for up to 2 hours, queue message for manual export review by IT staff if retries exhausted, log export failure with message ID and error details, and alert IT staff via email that clinical documentation export is failing
- **Response Time SLA Violation:** If urgent message exceeds 4-hour response time or routine message exceeds 24-hour response time (measured during business hours), the system SHALL send escalation alert to nursing supervisor and provider's manager via email with message details and time elapsed, display overdue status in provider message queue highlighted in red, and log SLA violation to quality metrics dashboard for reporting

---

#### FR-008: Patient Identity Verification for Registration

**Description:** New patients registering for portal access must be verified against the Epic EHR system to confirm their identity before granting access, with manual verification fallback for cases where automated matching fails.

**Business Rationale:** HIPAA requires verification of patient identity before granting access to PHI; automated verification reduces office staff burden while manual fallback ensures all patients can gain access even if data quality issues prevent automated matching.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The system SHALL require patients to provide first name, last name, date of birth (DOB), and medical record number (MRN) during registration
- The system SHALL query Epic EHR via API to match provided patient information (name, DOB, MRN) against patient master index
- The system SHALL grant automated registration approval (send email verification link) if exact match found on all fields: last name, first name, DOB, and MRN
- The system SHALL flag registration for manual verification if automated match fails (any field mismatch or MRN not found), and display message to patient: "We couldn't automatically verify your identity. Please call [office number] during business hours for assistance."
- The system SHALL provide office staff administrative interface showing pending manual verification requests with patient-provided information and suggested Epic matches (fuzzy matching on name/DOB)
- The system SHALL allow office staff to manually approve registration after verifying patient identity via standard procedures (photo ID check, verbal confirmation), with approval action logged to audit trail including staff member name, timestamp, and verification method used
- The system SHALL limit registration attempts to 3 failed identity verification attempts per email address within 24-hour period to prevent brute force attacks, displaying message after 3rd failure: "Maximum verification attempts exceeded. Please contact the office for assistance."

**Error/Exception Scenarios:**

- **Epic Patient Match API Failure:** If Epic API is unavailable or times out during identity verification query, the system SHALL queue registration request for manual verification, display message to patient: "Identity verification temporarily unavailable. We will review your registration and contact you within 1 business day," log API failure to system error log, and alert IT staff via email if API unavailability persists >30 minutes
- **Duplicate Email Address Detected:** If patient attempts to register using email address already associated with another patient account, the system SHALL reject registration, display message: "This email address is already associated with a patient portal account. If you've forgotten your login credentials, use the 'Forgot Password' link. If you believe this is an error, contact the office at [phone number]," and log duplicate email attempt with provided patient details to security audit log for potential fraud investigation

---

#### FR-009: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

**Description:** All portal users must complete multi-factor authentication (MFA) during login to add additional security layer beyond username/password, protecting against credential theft and unauthorized access.

**Business Rationale:** Username/password authentication alone is insufficient for protecting sensitive PHI; MFA significantly reduces risk of unauthorized access from stolen credentials, phishing attacks, and brute force attacks, which is critical for HIPAA compliance and patient privacy.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The system SHALL require all users (patients, providers, office staff) to set up MFA during initial account activation before granting portal access
- The system SHALL support at least two MFA methods: SMS code sent to registered mobile phone number, and time-based one-time password (TOTP) via authenticator app (e.g., Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator)
- The system SHALL prompt user for MFA code on every login attempt after successful username/password validation
- The system SHALL generate 6-digit numeric MFA codes valid for 5 minutes (SMS codes) or 30-second rotation (TOTP codes)
- The system SHALL allow maximum 3 MFA code verification attempts per login session; after 3 failed attempts, the system SHALL lock account for 15 minutes and display message: "Too many failed verification attempts. Please try again in 15 minutes or contact the office for assistance."
- The system SHALL provide account recovery mechanism for users who lose access to MFA device: user requests recovery via email to registered address, office staff verifies identity via phone call and manually resets MFA enrollment, and action is logged to audit trail
- The system SHALL allow users to manage MFA methods in account settings: add backup MFA method, remove old MFA method (requires current MFA verification), and view trusted devices (where "remember this device for 30 days" option was selected)

**Error/Exception Scenarios:**

- **SMS Delivery Failure:** If SMS MFA code fails to deliver (carrier error, invalid number), the system SHALL display message: "Unable to send verification code via SMS. Please try again or contact the office for assistance," log delivery failure with user identifier and phone number to system error log, and allow user to select alternative MFA method (TOTP app) if configured as backup
- **TOTP Clock Skew:** If user-entered TOTP code is rejected due to device clock skew (user device time not synchronized), the system SHALL accept codes from previous or next 30-second time window (±1 time step tolerance), log clock skew event to system monitoring, and display message to user: "Your device clock may be out of sync. Please ensure your device time is set correctly."

---

#### FR-010: Session Timeout and Security Controls

**Description:** The system must automatically terminate inactive user sessions after 15 minutes to prevent unauthorized access from unattended devices, particularly in shared computer environments.

**Business Rationale:** HIPAA requires automatic logoff controls to protect PHI from unauthorized viewing on unattended devices; 15-minute timeout balances security requirements with user experience.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The system SHALL track user activity (mouse movement, keyboard input, clicks) and reset inactivity timer on any detected activity
- The system SHALL display timeout warning modal dialog after 13 minutes of inactivity: "Your session will expire in 2 minutes due to inactivity. Click 'Continue' to remain logged in."
- The system SHALL automatically log out user and terminate session after 15 minutes of inactivity if user does not respond to warning dialog
- The system SHALL display message after automatic logout: "Your session has expired due to inactivity. Please log in again to continue." and redirect to login page
- The system SHALL clear all cached PHI data from browser memory/storage upon session termination to prevent recovery of sensitive information
- The system SHALL log all session timeouts to audit trail with user identifier, session start time, timeout time, and last activity timestamp

**Error/Exception Scenarios:**

- **User Has Unsaved Work at Timeout:** If user has unsaved changes in message compose form or other input field when session times out, the system SHALL preserve draft content in browser local storage (encrypted), and restore draft content upon successful re-login with prompt: "We restored your unsaved message from your previous session. Would you like to continue editing or discard?"
- **Network Disconnection During Active Session:** If user's network connection is lost during active session (e.g., mobile user loses wifi), the system SHALL detect disconnection on next user action attempt, display message: "Connection lost. Please check your internet connection and log in again," terminate server-side session after 15-minute timeout, and require full re-authentication upon reconnection

### P1: Should-Have Requirements

#### FR-011: Waitlist for Fully Booked Providers

**Description:** When patients attempt to schedule appointments with fully booked providers (no available slots in next 60 days), they should be able to join a waitlist and receive automatic notification when cancellations create available slots.

**Business Rationale:** Popular providers often have fully booked schedules; waitlist functionality improves patient satisfaction by enabling access to preferred providers rather than forcing selection of less-preferred alternatives.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The system SHALL display "Join Waitlist" option when patient's selected provider has zero available slots in the next 60 days for the requested appointment type
- The system SHALL allow patient to join waitlist by confirming preferred date range (e.g., "Any time in next 30 days", "Mornings only", "Specific week of [date]") and preferred office location
- The system SHALL automatically monitor provider schedule for cancellations or newly added availability matching waitlisted patient preferences
- The system SHALL send email and SMS notification to waitlisted patient within 5 minutes of matching slot becoming available, with message: "An appointment with [provider] is now available on [date] at [time]. Click here to book this appointment (available for next 24 hours)."
- The system SHALL hold newly available slot for 24 hours exclusively for waitlisted patient; if patient does not book within 24 hours, the system SHALL release slot to general availability and notify next patient on waitlist
- The system SHALL allow patients to view and cancel waitlist requests in "My Appointments" section showing waitlist status, preferences, and position in queue

**Error/Exception Scenarios:**

- **Multiple Waitlisted Patients Competing for Same Slot:** If multiple patients are waitlisted for same provider/time preferences and slot becomes available, the system SHALL notify patients in FIFO order (first on waitlist notified first), hold slot for 24 hours for first notified patient, and notify next waitlisted patient only if first patient declines or 24-hour hold expires
- **Patient Books Appointment While on Waitlist:** If patient books different appointment while still on waitlist for preferred provider, the system SHALL ask during booking confirmation: "You are currently on the waitlist for [provider]. Do you want to remain on the waitlist or cancel it?" and process patient selection accordingly

---

#### FR-012: Provider Response Time Tracking and Metrics

**Description:** The system should track provider response times for secure messages, display metrics to providers and administrative staff, and generate alerts when response time service levels are at risk of violation.

**Business Rationale:** Monitoring response times ensures the organization meets patient service commitments, identifies providers needing support to manage message volume, and provides accountability for patient communication quality.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The system SHALL calculate response time for each message as elapsed time from patient message timestamp to first provider/nurse response timestamp, measured in business hours (M-F 8 AM - 5 PM, excluding holidays)
- The system SHALL display provider's current message queue with color-coded response time indicators: green (<12 hours elapsed for routine, <2 hours for urgent), yellow (12-20 hours for routine, 2-3 hours for urgent), red (>20 hours for routine, >3 hours for urgent)
- The system SHALL generate daily summary email to each provider showing: total messages received yesterday, average response time, oldest unanswered message age, and count of messages exceeding SLA targets
- The system SHALL provide administrative dashboard for office managers showing: response time metrics by provider (average, median, 90th percentile), SLA compliance rate per provider, total message volume trends, and top providers by message volume
- The system SHALL send escalation alert to provider's supervisor if routine message exceeds 20 hours or urgent message exceeds 3 hours without response, including message preview and patient MRN
- The system SHALL exclude messages sent outside business hours from SLA calculation until next business day (e.g., message sent Saturday 3 PM starts SLA clock Monday 8 AM)

**Error/Exception Scenarios:**

- **Provider Out of Office/On Vacation:** If provider is marked "Out of Office" in system and has delegate provider assigned, the system SHALL route new messages to delegate provider's queue, notify delegate via email of new message assignment, and exclude original provider from response time SLA metrics during OOO period
- **Message Requires Multi-Disciplinary Response:** If nurse routes message to multiple providers for input (e.g., patient taking medications from both cardiologist and endocrinologist), the system SHALL track response time per provider separately, require all consulted providers to respond before message is marked "Resolved," and display combined response in single threaded message to patient

---

#### FR-013: Downloadable Medical Records

**Description:** Patients should be able to download or print their medical records (lab results, medication lists, immunization records, visit summaries) as PDF files for personal records or sharing with other healthcare providers.

**Business Rationale:** Patients have legal right to access and obtain copies of their medical records under HIPAA; enabling self-service download improves patient satisfaction and reduces office staff time spent fulfilling records requests.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The system SHALL provide "Download as PDF" button on each medical record section (Lab Results, Medication List, Immunization Records, Visit Summaries)
- The system SHALL generate PDF file containing selected medical record data formatted for readability, including: patient name, date of birth, MRN, record type, date range of included data, and practice contact information
- The system SHALL watermark downloaded PDF with "Downloaded from Patient Portal on [date] by [patient name]" footer on each page
- The system SHALL allow patients to select date range filter before download (e.g., "Lab results from past 6 months", "All immunization records") to control PDF size and content
- The system SHALL log each medical record download to audit trail with patient MRN, record type downloaded, date range, and timestamp
- The system SHALL include disclaimer on downloaded PDFs: "This is a patient portal download and may not include complete medical record. For official medical records, contact [office name] Medical Records Department."

**Error/Exception Scenarios:**

- **Large Record Set Causes PDF Generation Timeout:** If patient selects "All lab results" spanning 10+ years and PDF generation exceeds 60-second timeout, the system SHALL display message: "The date range selected is too large. Please select a shorter date range (maximum 2 years per download)," and suggest patient contact Medical Records Department for comprehensive record requests
- **PDF Generation Service Failure:** If PDF generation service is unavailable or fails, the system SHALL display message: "Download temporarily unavailable. Please try again shortly," log service failure to system error log, and alert IT staff via email if service unavailability persists >15 minutes

---

#### FR-014: Business Associate Agreement (BAA) Tracking

**Description:** The system should track and maintain Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) with all third-party service providers that process, store, or transmit patient health information (PHI) as required by HIPAA.

**Business Rationale:** HIPAA requires covered entities to have signed BAAs with all business associates handling PHI; failure to maintain BAAs creates compliance violations and significant legal liability.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The system SHALL maintain administrative interface for Compliance Officer to record BAA details: third-party service name, service description, PHI data elements shared, BAA execution date, BAA expiration date (if applicable), and copy of signed BAA document uploaded as PDF
- The system SHALL display dashboard showing all active business associates, BAA status (Active, Expiring Soon, Expired, Missing), and PHI data shared with each
- The system SHALL send automated alert to Compliance Officer 90 days before BAA expiration date, 60 days before, and 30 days before, with message: "BAA with [service name] expires on [date]. Please renew before expiration to maintain HIPAA compliance."
- The system SHALL flag any third-party service used by portal that does not have active BAA on file, and send immediate alert to Compliance Officer and IT Director
- The system SHALL generate quarterly BAA compliance report listing all business associates, BAA status, and any gaps for executive review
- The system SHALL prevent integration of new third-party services until Compliance Officer marks BAA as received and active in tracking system

**Error/Exception Scenarios:**

- **BAA Expires Without Renewal:** If BAA expiration date passes without renewal being recorded, the system SHALL send immediate alert to Compliance Officer, IT Director, and Practice Administrator with subject line: "URGENT: HIPAA Compliance Risk - Expired BAA with [service name]," display BAA status as "EXPIRED - Immediate Action Required" in dashboard, and recommend immediate service disconnection until BAA is renewed
- **Service Discovered Without BAA:** If IT staff integrates new third-party service that processes PHI without first obtaining BAA and recording in tracking system, the system SHALL detect integration via API usage monitoring, send immediate alert to Compliance Officer with service details, and flag service in dashboard as "Missing BAA - Compliance Risk"

---

### P2: Nice-to-Have Requirements

#### FR-015: Mobile App for iOS and Android

**Description:** Patients should be able to access portal functionality via native mobile applications for iOS and Android platforms, optimized for smartphone interfaces.

**Business Rationale:** Many patients prefer mobile apps over web browsers for convenience and better user experience; mobile apps can leverage device features like biometric authentication and push notifications to improve engagement.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The system SHALL provide native mobile applications for iOS (App Store) and Android (Google Play Store) with feature parity to web portal
- The mobile app SHALL support biometric authentication (Face ID, Touch ID on iOS; fingerprint/face unlock on Android) as alternative to password entry after initial account setup
- The mobile app SHALL use push notifications for appointment reminders and secure message replies, replacing or supplementing email/SMS notifications based on patient preference
- The mobile app SHALL optimize UI for smartphone screen sizes with touch-friendly interface elements and mobile-appropriate navigation patterns
- The mobile app SHALL support offline viewing of previously loaded medical records (cached locally in encrypted storage) with clear indicator that data may not be current
- The mobile app SHALL comply with Apple App Store and Google Play Store security and privacy requirements

**Error/Exception Scenarios:**

- **Push Notification Permission Denied:** If user denies push notification permissions during app setup, the app SHALL continue to function normally using email/SMS reminders as configured in portal settings, and display optional prompt in app settings: "Enable push notifications for faster appointment reminders and message alerts"
- **Biometric Authentication Fails:** If biometric authentication fails (fingerprint not recognized, Face ID error), the app SHALL fall back to password + MFA code entry after 3 failed biometric attempts, and log biometric failure events to user's security log for audit purposes

---

#### FR-016: In-App Educational Content

**Description:** The portal should provide condition-specific educational content and health resources relevant to each patient's diagnoses, medications, and health interests.

**Business Rationale:** Patient education improves health outcomes, medication adherence, and patient engagement; providing personalized educational content within portal increases patient utilization and satisfaction.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The system SHALL display personalized educational content on patient dashboard based on active diagnoses and medications retrieved from Epic EHR (e.g., patient with diabetes diagnosis sees "Managing Type 2 Diabetes" content)
- The system SHALL curate educational content library covering common conditions treated by practice's specialties, with content reviewed and approved by clinical staff
- The system SHALL allow patients to browse educational content by category (conditions, medications, procedures, wellness topics) and search by keyword
- The system SHALL track which educational resources each patient views and log to Epic EHR for provider visibility during visits
- The system SHALL provide "Ask my provider" button on educational content pages to allow patients to message care team with questions about content
- The system SHALL source educational content from reputable medical sources (e.g., Mayo Clinic, CDC, medical specialty societies) with proper attribution and last-reviewed dates

**Error/Exception Scenarios:**

- **Diagnosis Mismatch Shows Irrelevant Content:** If patient's Epic diagnosis codes include outdated or resolved conditions (e.g., broken arm from 5 years ago), the system SHALL filter educational content suggestions to active diagnoses only (based on diagnosis status field in Epic), and allow patients to hide content recommendations they find irrelevant via "Not relevant to me" option
- **Educational Content Source Link Broken:** If linked external educational resource (e.g., CDC webpage) returns 404 error or is unavailable, the system SHALL display message: "This resource is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later or contact your provider for information," log broken link to content management queue for IT staff review and content replacement

---

## 7. Business Processes

### Process 1: Patient Onboarding to Portal

**Current State:**
- Patients receive printed materials about patient portal during office visits
- Office staff verbally encourage portal registration but do not systematically track enrollment
- Patients must call office during business hours to receive registration instructions
- Identity verification is entirely manual via phone call, consuming staff time
- Portal adoption rate is low (<30% of eligible patients) due to friction in enrollment process

**Future State:**
- Patients receive automated email invitation to register for portal within 24 hours of first office visit
- Registration process is self-service via web browser with automated identity verification
- Manual verification fallback available for edge cases (data quality issues)
- Office staff monitor pending manual verification queue and process within 1 business day
- Portal enrollment tracked via admin dashboard with target 60% enrollment within first year

**Process Flow (Future State):**

1. **Trigger:** New patient completes first office visit and is entered into Epic EHR
2. **Automated Invitation (24 hours post-visit):** System sends personalized email to patient's email address on file: "Welcome to [Practice Name]! You now have access to our patient portal. Click here to register and view your medical records, schedule appointments, and message your care team."
3. **Patient Self-Service Registration:** Patient clicks registration link, completes form with name/DOB/MRN/email/phone, and submits
4. **Automated Identity Verification:** System queries Epic to match provided information against patient master index
   - **IF MATCH:** System sends email verification link; patient activates account and sets up MFA
   - **IF NO MATCH:** System flags for manual verification and notifies patient to call office
5. **Manual Verification (if needed):** Office staff reviews pending verification queue daily, calls patient to verify identity via standard procedure, and manually approves registration
6. **Account Activation:** Patient completes email verification, creates password meeting security requirements, sets up MFA (SMS or authenticator app), and logs in for first time
7. **Welcome Tutorial:** System displays optional interactive tutorial highlighting key features (skip or complete)
8. **Dashboard Access:** Patient lands on personalized dashboard showing upcoming appointments, recent messages, new lab results, and quick actions

**Stakeholders:**
- **Patients:** Self-service registration with minimal friction
- **Office Staff:** Manual verification queue processing for edge cases; monitor enrollment metrics
- **IT Team:** Monitor automated verification match rates and troubleshoot Epic integration issues
- **Compliance Officer:** Audit identity verification procedures and access controls

**Success Metrics:**
- 60% of new patients register for portal within 30 days of first visit
- 90% of registrations succeed via automated identity verification (10% require manual verification)
- Average manual verification processing time <4 hours during business days
- Zero identity verification errors (wrong patient granted access to another patient's records)

---

### Process 2: Secure Messaging Triage and Response

**Current State:**
- Patients call office phone during business hours with questions and concerns
- Front desk staff interrupt providers during patient visits to relay urgent messages
- Nurse call-backs documented inconsistently; some documented in Epic, some on paper, some lost
- No systematic tracking of patient inquiry response times
- Providers spend 1-2 hours after clinic returning patient phone calls

**Future State:**
- Patients send secure messages via portal 24/7; messages triaged by nursing staff during business hours
- Urgent messages generate real-time alerts to on-call provider; routine messages batched for provider review during administrative time
- All message threads automatically documented in Epic EHR
- Response time tracked and monitored; escalations triggered if SLA at risk
- Providers respond to messages during designated administrative time blocks, reducing after-hours work

**Process Flow (Future State):**

1. **Patient Sends Message:** Patient logs into portal, composes message with subject/body, selects urgency (Routine or Urgent), and sends to care team
2. **Message Queue Routing:** System adds message to care team message queue; nurses notified via email
3. **Nurse Triage (within 1 hour during business hours):**
   - Nurse reviews message and patient chart context from Epic
   - **IF routine clinical question within nursing scope:** Nurse responds directly to patient with guidance
   - **IF requires provider clinical judgment:** Nurse routes message to assigned provider's queue with priority flag
   - **IF urgent clinical concern:** Nurse flags message as urgent and sends real-time email/SMS alert to on-call provider
   - **IF administrative question (billing, scheduling):** Nurse routes to office staff queue
4. **Provider Response:**
   - Provider reviews message queue during designated administrative time block (e.g., daily 12-1 PM slot)
   - Provider reviews message, patient chart context, and responds with clinical guidance
   - Provider can escalate to phone call or office visit if message complexity requires
5. **Automatic Documentation:** System exports complete message thread (patient message + nurse/provider responses) to Epic EHR within 5 minutes
6. **Patient Notification:** System sends email to patient: "Your provider has responded to your message. Log in to view response."
7. **Response Time Monitoring:** System tracks elapsed time and sends escalation alert to nursing supervisor if SLA at risk (>20 hours routine, >3 hours urgent)

**Stakeholders:**
- **Patients:** Convenient asynchronous communication; documented clinical guidance
- **Nursing Staff:** Triage messages and respond to routine inquiries; escalate complex issues
- **Providers:** Respond during designated admin time; clinical communication automatically documented
- **Office Staff:** Monitor response time metrics and intervene on escalations
- **Compliance Officer:** Audit message documentation in Epic for completeness

**Success Metrics:**
- 80% of routine patient messages responded to within 24 business hours
- 95% of urgent messages responded to within 4 business hours
- 70% of routine questions resolved by nursing staff without provider escalation
- 100% of message threads documented in Epic EHR within 5 minutes
- Provider after-hours phone call time reduced by 50%

6. **IT Staff Capability:** Existing 2-person IT team has sufficient technical skills to manage vendor relationships, monitor system health, and troubleshoot integration issues with vendor support; does not require extensive custom development skills

7. **Budget Availability:** Practice has sufficient budget to cover: portal software subscription fees, Epic integration fees, third-party service costs (email/SMS/hosting), initial implementation costs, and ongoing support costs

8. **Patient Demand:** Patients desire digital self-service capabilities and will adopt portal when convenient access is provided; reducing phone call friction will increase utilization

9. **Regulatory Stability:** HIPAA requirements and healthcare data access regulations will remain stable during implementation timeframe (no major regulatory changes requiring significant system rework)

10. **Provider Panel Assignments:** Epic accurately maintains provider-patient panel assignments (which patients are assigned to which providers) to support role-based access controls and message routing

### Constraints

1. **Small IT Team:** IT team limited to 2 personnel; solution must prioritize vendor-supported SaaS/cloud offerings over custom development; ongoing maintenance burden must be <5 hours/week after initial implementation

2. **Epic Integration Dependency:** Portal is fully dependent on Epic EHR as source of truth for clinical data; Epic API downtime or integration failures directly impact portal functionality

3. **HIPAA Compliance Mandatory:** All design decisions must prioritize HIPAA compliance; features that create compliance risk cannot be implemented regardless of patient demand

4. **Budget Constraints:** Solution must demonstrate ROI (return on investment) within 18 months via staff time savings; executive leadership has limited appetite for multi-year payback periods

5. **Legacy Infrastructure:** Practice office locations have varying internet bandwidth availability; portal must function adequately on connections as slow as 5 Mbps download

6. **Limited Training Time:** Clinical staff have limited availability for training (maximum 2 hours per role); portal admin interfaces must be intuitive and require minimal training

7. **Existing Phone-Based Culture:** Subset of patients (estimated 20-30%, primarily older adults) prefer phone communication and may resist portal adoption; phone-based access must remain available

8. **No Dedicated Project Manager:** Practice does not have dedicated project management resources; IT Director will manage vendor relationship alongside other responsibilities; vendor must provide strong project management and implementation support

9. **Multi-Location Complexity:** 3 office locations with different provider schedules, appointment types, and operational workflows; portal must accommodate location-specific configurations

10. **Security Restrictions:** Practice security policies prohibit storing PHI on employee personal devices; mobile app must enforce device security requirements (PIN/biometric lock, remote wipe capability) or operate in browser-only mode

## 12. Risks and Mitigation Strategies

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|------------|---------------------|
| **Low Patient Adoption Rate** - Patients do not register for or actively use portal, failing to achieve ROI targets | **High** - ROI depends on patient self-service reducing staff workload; <40% adoption means insufficient phone call reduction and failed business case | **Medium** - Patient technology access and proficiency vary; subset of patients resistant to change | **Mitigation:** (1) Multi-channel marketing campaign promoting portal benefits during office visits, via email, and on practice website; (2) Staff training to encourage enrollment during check-in; (3) Incentive program (e.g., "Register for portal and receive $5 off copay"); (4) Monitor adoption metrics weekly and adjust outreach strategy; (5) Identify and address barriers via patient surveys |
| **Epic Integration Failures** - Epic API downtime or data sync issues prevent portal from accessing current patient data | **High** - Portal is fully dependent on Epic for clinical data; extended Epic API outages render portal unusable for medical record access | **Medium** - Epic is enterprise-grade system with high reliability, but integration points introduce risk; API changes or upgrades may break integration | **Mitigation:** (1) Negotiate SLA with Epic for API uptime (target 99.9%); (2) Implement caching layer to display stale data (with prominent staleness warning) during Epic outages <4 hours; (3) Automated monitoring and alerts for Epic API failures; (4) Establish Epic support escalation process for critical integration issues; (5) Maintain vendor relationship with portal provider to quickly address Epic API changes |
| **HIPAA Compliance Violation** - Unauthorized PHI access, data breach, or audit log failure creates compliance violation | **Critical** - HIPAA violations result in severe financial penalties (up to $1.9M per violation category per year), legal liability, reputation damage, and patient loss of trust | **Low** - Risk can be minimized via strong technical controls and vendor selection, but cannot be eliminated entirely | **Mitigation:** (1) Select portal vendor with proven HIPAA compliance track record and existing healthcare customers; (2) Obtain BAAs from all third-party service providers before processing PHI; (3) Implement comprehensive technical safeguards (encryption, access controls, audit logging, MFA); (4) Conduct annual HIPAA risk assessment and security audit; (5) Provide HIPAA training for all staff; (6) Maintain cyber liability insurance; (7) Develop breach response plan |
| **Provider Resistance to Secure Messaging Workload** - Providers refuse to respond to patient messages or respond inconsistently, leading to patient dissatisfaction and liability | **High** - Patient dissatisfaction damages practice reputation; inconsistent responses create medical liability risk; benefits of secure messaging are not realized | **Medium** - Providers are busy and may view patient messages as additional burden on top of existing workload; lack of compensation for messaging time | **Mitigation:** (1) Practice leadership sets clear expectations and messaging response as core job responsibility; (2) Allocate dedicated administrative time blocks for message review (e.g., 30 min daily); (3) Nursing staff triage messages and resolve routine questions, reducing provider burden; (4) Monitor response time metrics and provide feedback; (5) Consider compensation model adjustments to account for messaging time; (6) Demonstrate value via reduced phone call interruptions during clinical time |
| **IT Support Burden Exceeds Capacity** - System requires >5 hours/week ongoing support, overwhelming 2-person IT team | **Medium** - IT staff burnout and inability to support other practice systems; potential system neglect leading to performance degradation | **Medium** - Vendor-supported SaaS reduces risk, but patient support requests and Epic integration issues may consume significant time | **Mitigation:** (1) Select vendor with strong customer support SLA and proven responsiveness; (2) Implement comprehensive self-service help content within portal to reduce support ticket volume; (3) Train office staff to handle Tier 1 portal support (password resets, registration assistance) to deflect from IT; (4) Monitor IT support time weekly and escalate to vendor if exceeds threshold; (5) Negotiate vendor SLA including maximum response time for critical issues |
| **Security Breach or Ransomware Attack** - Portal or cloud infrastructure compromised by cyberattack, exposing patient PHI | **Critical** - PHI exposure triggers HIPAA breach notification requirements, potential fines, lawsuits, reputation damage, and loss of patient trust | **Low** - Cyberattacks on healthcare are increasing but can be mitigated via strong security controls and vendor selection | **Mitigation:** (1) Select cloud hosting provider with SOC 2 Type II certification and healthcare customer base; (2) Implement defense-in-depth security: encryption, MFA, network segmentation, intrusion detection, DDoS protection; (3) Conduct annual penetration testing; (4) Maintain offline encrypted backups of critical data; (5) Develop incident response plan and breach notification procedures; (6) Maintain cyber liability insurance; (7) Conduct security awareness training for all staff (phishing, social engineering) |
| **Vendor Bankruptcy or Service Discontinuation** - Portal software vendor goes out of business or discontinues product, requiring migration to new vendor | **High** - System migration is disruptive, expensive, and time-consuming; temporary service disruption during migration harms patient experience | **Low** - Risk can be minimized by selecting established vendor with proven track record, but cannot be eliminated | **Mitigation:** (1) Select vendor with strong financial position and existing customer base; (2) Negotiate contract terms including data export rights and source code escrow; (3) Avoid vendor lock-in by selecting vendor supporting industry standards (FHIR, SMART on FHIR); (4) Maintain documentation of Epic integration to facilitate future migration; (5) Monitor vendor financial health and customer satisfaction |
| **Epic EHR System Replacement** - Practice decides to replace Epic with different EHR vendor, requiring portal re-integration | **High** - Portal re-integration with new EHR is complex and expensive; temporary disruption to portal functionality during migration | **Very Low** - Epic is significant investment and migration is costly; practice unlikely to switch EHR in near term | **Mitigation:** (1) Select portal vendor with experience integrating with multiple EHR systems (Epic, Cerner, Allscripts, etc.); (2) Avoid deep Epic-specific customizations that would be difficult to migrate; (3) Maintain documentation of integration architecture to facilitate future EHR migration if needed |
| **Appointment Scheduling Logic Errors** - Portal displays incorrect available appointment slots or double-books providers, causing patient dissatisfaction and operational chaos | **High** - Double-booking wastes provider time and creates patient dissatisfaction; incorrect availability frustrates patients | **Medium** - Complex scheduling rules (appointment types, durations, provider availability, location) create opportunities for logic errors | **Mitigation:** (1) Conduct thorough testing of scheduling logic across all appointment types, providers, and locations before launch; (2) Implement real-time synchronization with Epic scheduling system (not batch sync) to minimize race conditions; (3) Implement optimistic locking to prevent double-booking when multiple patients attempt to book same slot; (4) Monitor scheduling errors via automated alerts and patient feedback; (5) Provide manual override capability for office staff to correct errors; (6) Phased rollout: enable scheduling for subset of appointment types initially, expand after validating accuracy |
