## Section-by-Section Guidance

### Executive Summary

**Purpose:** Provide high-level overview for stakeholders who need to quickly understand the project.

**Content to include:**
- Project name or codename (if known)
- 1-sentence statement of primary business objective
- Target user group(s)
- Expected business value or impact (revenue, cost savings, efficiency)

**Length:** 2-3 paragraphs maximum

**Tone:** Professional, concise, business-focused

**Example:**
"The Customer Portal Redesign project aims to reduce customer support ticket volume by 30% by enabling self-service for common tasks. The portal will serve 50,000+ existing enterprise customers who currently must email or call support for routine account management, billing inquiries, and usage reporting. By empowering customers to manage their accounts independently, we expect to save $500K annually in support costs while improving customer satisfaction scores."

### Business Context

**Purpose:** Explain why this product is needed now and how it fits into the larger business strategy.

**Content to include:**
- Current state challenges or pain points
- Market drivers (competitive pressure, customer demands, regulatory changes)
- Strategic alignment (how this supports company goals)

**Length:** 1-2 paragraphs

**Example:**
"Our current manual order processing system requires 5 staff members to handle 200 orders daily, with a 3-day average fulfillment time. Competitors have launched automated systems offering same-day fulfillment, putting pressure on our market share. Additionally, our manual process has a 12% error rate leading to customer complaints and costly refunds. Automating order processing aligns with our strategic initiative to improve operational efficiency and customer experience."

### Business Objectives

- Must be measurable and specific
- Include target value and timeline when possible
- Explain why this matters to the business

**Secondary Objectives:**
- List additional goals that support or complement primary objective
- Each should have clear business rationale
- Prioritize based on business value

**Example:**

**Primary Objective:**
Reduce customer onboarding time from 14 days to 2 days by automating account setup and data migration. This enables faster time-to-value for customers, improves customer satisfaction scores, and accelerates revenue recognition by 12 days per customer.

**Secondary Objectives:**
1. Decrease customer support tickets related to onboarding by 50%, allowing support team to focus on complex issues requiring human expertise
2. Improve onboarding completion rate from 78% to 95%, reducing customer churn before first value realization

**Example:**

### Flow 1: Generate Weekly Sales Report
**User Persona:** Regional Sales Manager
**Business Goal:** Enable data-driven decision making and reduce time spent on administrative tasks
**User Goal:** Create comprehensive weekly sales report in under 15 minutes

**Steps:**
1. User clicks "Reports" in main navigation
2. System displays report templates library
3. User selects "Weekly Sales Summary" template
4. System displays report configuration screen pre-populated with user's region and team
5. User adjusts date range to current week (Monday-Sunday)
6. User clicks "Generate Report"
7. System retrieves data from CRM, processes calculations, and displays report preview (typical: 10-15 seconds)
8. User reviews report sections: team performance, pipeline status, deal progression, forecast accuracy
9. If satisfied: User clicks "Export to PDF" or "Send to Email"
10. If adjustments needed: User clicks "Customize" to add/remove sections, then returns to step 7
11. System generates PDF and sends to user's email within 1 minute
12. User forwards report to executives and team members

**Error scenarios:**
- If data retrieval takes >30 seconds, system displays progress indicator with status
- If required data unavailable, system shows specific error and suggests resolution

### Functional Requirements

**Purpose:** Specify what the product must do, organized by priority to enable MVP scoping and phased delivery.

**Priority Levels:**
- **Priority 0 (Must-Have):** Product cannot launch without these. Core functionality required for business objectives.
- **Priority 1 (Should-Have):** Important for full solution but could be deferred to v2 if necessary. Significantly improves value.
- **Priority 2 (Nice-to-Have):** Enhances product but not essential. Consider for future phases based on user feedback.

**For each requirement:**

**Requirement Title:** Short, descriptive name

**Description:** What is needed (functional capability, not technical implementation)

**Business Rationale:** Why it matters to business objectives

**User Story:** As a [user type], I need [capability] so that [benefit achieved]

**Success Criteria:** How to verify requirement is met (testable, measurable)

**Example:**

### Must-Have Requirements (Priority 0)

1. **Automated Report Generation**
   - Description: System automatically retrieves sales data from CRM, processes calculations (totals, averages, trends), and generates formatted report without manual data entry or manipulation.
   - Business rationale: Reduces report creation time from 4 hours to 15 minutes, directly supporting primary objective of improving efficiency. Eliminates manual errors that undermine decision quality.
   - User story: As a Regional Sales Manager, I need automated report generation so that I can spend 4 hours per week coaching my team instead of compiling data.
   - Success criteria: User can generate complete weekly sales report in under 15 minutes from login to PDF export. Report data matches CRM source data with 100% accuracy.

2. **Report Template Library**
   - Description: Pre-built report templates for common reporting needs (weekly sales, monthly forecast, pipeline analysis, team performance). User selects template and system applies appropriate data queries and formatting.
   - Business rationale: Standardizes reporting across regions, enabling executives to compare performance. Reduces learning curve for new users.
   - User story: As a Regional Sales Manager, I need standardized report templates so that my reports are consistent with other regions and I don't have to design layouts from scratch.
   - Success criteria: Library includes minimum 5 report templates covering weekly, monthly, and quarterly timeframes. User can generate any template in under 30 seconds from selection to preview.

### Business Processes

**Purpose:** Document how current processes work and how the product will improve them, ensuring solution fits into existing workflows.

**For each process:**

**Current State:**
- How process works today
- Pain points and inefficiencies
- Time required
- Error rates
- People involved

**Future State:**
- How product will improve process
- Specific improvements (faster, more accurate, less manual work)
- New capabilities enabled

**Process Flow:**
- Step-by-step description of future state workflow
- Decision points
- Handoffs between people or systems

**Stakeholders:**
- Who is involved
- What their role is

**Example:**

### Process 1: Weekly Sales Review Meeting Preparation
- **Current State:** Regional Sales Manager spends Monday morning (4 hours) manually extracting data from CRM, copying into Excel, calculating totals and trends, formatting charts, and creating PowerPoint presentation. Process is error-prone due to manual data entry. Manager often discovers data errors during Tuesday meeting, undermining credibility. No time to analyze trends or identify coaching opportunities before meeting.

- **Future State:** Regional Sales Manager generates report in 15 minutes on Monday morning using automated system. Spends remaining 3.75 hours analyzing trends, identifying coaching opportunities, and preparing specific action plans for team. Arrives at Tuesday meeting with data-driven insights rather than just raw numbers. Data accuracy is guaranteed since no manual copying.

- **Process Flow:**
  1. Monday 8:00 AM: Manager logs into system and selects "Weekly Sales Report" template
  2. System generates report with all current data (10 minutes)
  3. Manager reviews report and exports to PDF (5 minutes)
  4. Manager spends 8:00-11:45 AM analyzing trends and preparing coaching plans
  5. Tuesday 9:00 AM: Manager presents report in team meeting, focusing discussion on trends and actions rather than defending data accuracy

- **Stakeholders:** Regional Sales Manager (report creator and presenter), Sales Representatives (report subjects and consumers), VP of Sales (report consumer and decision maker)
