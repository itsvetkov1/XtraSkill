### US-01: Real-Time Requirement Extraction
**As a Business Analyst**, I want the system to extract draft requirements from a live interview recording or transcript so that I can reduce the time spent on manual transcription and initial categorization.

**Priority:** P0 (Must Have)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given a live audio stream or uploaded transcript, the system must identify and tag potential "Requirement" entities within 60 seconds of the statement being processed.
2. The system must categorize extracted entities into 'Functional', 'Non-Functional', or 'Business Rule' based on the definitions in the [Glossary](#glossary).
3. **Error Scenario 1:** If the audio quality falls below the configured clarity threshold (default: 40%), the system must flag the specific segment for manual review with a "Low Confidence" indicator.
4. **Error Scenario 2:** If the transcript contains overlapping speakers that prevent distinct attribution, the system must highlight the segment as "Attribution Ambiguous" rather than guessing the actor.
5. The extracted requirements must be editable by the Business Analyst before being finalized in the draft repository.

### US-02: Gherkin-Style Transformation
**As a Business Analyst**, I want to convert unstructured interview notes into formal User Stories with Gherkin-style Acceptance Criteria so that the development team receives precise, testable documentation.

**Priority:** P0 (Must Have)
**Depends on:** US-01

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. The system must transform selected draft requirements into the "Given/When/Then" format for at least 80% of identified functional requirements.
2. Every generated User Story must include a "Success Threshold" (e.g., timing, counts, or specific states) as defined by the context of the interview.
3. **Error Scenario 1:** If the system cannot identify a clear trigger ("When") for a requirement, it must generate a "Missing Trigger" warning and prompt the user for manual input.
4. **Error Scenario 2:** If the system detects a circular dependency between two stories, it must flag the conflict in the "Logical Validation" panel.
5. All generated business values (e.g., dollar amounts, timeframes) must be stored as "Configurable Thresholds" rather than hardcoded text.

### US-03: Logical Gap Detection (Brainstorming)
**As a Business Analyst**, I want the system to analyze collected data to identify logical gaps or missing "Happy Path" alternatives so that I am fully prepared for follow-up stakeholder meetings.

**Priority:** P1 (Should Have)
**Depends on:** US-01, US-02

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. The system must identify at least 2 "Edge Case" scenarios for every "Happy Path" requirement identified.
2. The system must cross-reference extracted requirements against the "Industry Standard Framework" (default: SaaS/Enterprise) to flag missing categories like "Security" or "Audit Logs".
3. **Error Scenario 1:** If the system identifies more than 10 potential gaps for a single requirement, it must prioritize the top 3 based on "Risk Impact Score" and collapse the others into a "Secondary Findings" list.
4. **Error Scenario 2:** If the context provided in the interview is insufficient to perform gap analysis, the system must state "Context Insufficient" and provide 3 specific questions to gather the missing data.

### US-04: Follow-up Question Generation
**As a Business Analyst**, I want the system to generate a structured interview guide for my next meeting based on identified "Unknowns" so that I can efficiently close requirement gaps.

**Priority:** P1 (Should Have)
**Depends on:** US-03

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. The system must generate a list of at least 5 targeted questions derived directly from the "Logical Gap Detection" output.
2. Each question must include a "Rationale" explaining why the answer is critical for the current requirement set.
3. **Error Scenario 1:** If a generated question is redundant with a previously answered question in the transcript, the system must flag it as "Review: Potential Redundancy."
4. **Error Scenario 2:** If the system generates questions for a stakeholder persona not identified in the initial session, it must alert the user to "Verify Target Persona."

### US-05: Secure Access Control (SSO/RBAC)
**As an IT Administrator**, I want to manage access via Corporate SSO and Role-Based Access Control so that sensitive requirement data is protected from unauthorized access.

**Priority:** P0 (Must Have)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. The system must authenticate users via the configured Corporate SSO provider within 5 seconds of the login attempt.
2. Users with the 'Business Analyst' role must be restricted from deleting audit logs, while 'Admin' roles may view but not edit requirement content.
3. **Error Scenario 1:** Upon 3 failed authentication attempts from a non-SSO source, the account must be locked for the duration of the "Security Lockout Threshold" (default: 30 minutes).
4. **Error Scenario 2:** If a user attempts to access a project for which they do not have explicit "Grant Access" permissions, the system must log the attempt and return a "403 Unauthorized" status.

### Dependency Summary
- **US-02** and **US-03** require **US-01** to have a baseline of extracted data.
- **US-04** requires the logic engine output from **US-03** to generate relevant follow-ups.

### Glossary of Concepts
- **Acceptance Criteria (AC):** Specific conditions that a software product must meet to be accepted by a user or customer.
- **Gherkin:** A structured language (Given/When/Then) used to define test cases and requirements.
- **Logical Gap:** A scenario where a business process is missing a step, an error case, or a necessary decision point.
- **Configurable Threshold:** A variable value (like a timeout or limit) that can be adjusted in settings without changing the core requirement logic.
