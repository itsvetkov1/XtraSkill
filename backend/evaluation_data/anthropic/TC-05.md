I cannot generate a comprehensive Business Requirements Document based on our discussion.

**Here's why:**

You have provided **zero discovery responses** - only six implementation questions. I have no information about:

- ❌ **Business objectives** - What does success look like for your healthcare practice?
- ❌ **Target user personas** - Who are your patients? Who are your providers? What are their characteristics?
- ❌ **Current state challenges** - What problems exist today that this portal will solve?
- ❌ **Key user flows** - What specific workflows must patients and providers complete?
- ❌ **Success metrics** - How will you measure if this portal achieves its goals?
- ❌ **Stakeholder perspectives** - Who cares about this beyond patients (administrators, billing, compliance officers)?
- ❌ **Practice context** - Size of practice, patient volume, specialty areas, existing systems
- ❌ **Regulatory specifics** - Which HIPAA requirements apply to YOUR specific use case?

**What I do know:**
- You want a patient portal
- It should include: medical records, appointments, provider communication
- It must comply with HIPAA

**This is insufficient for a production-ready BRD.**

**I can offer you two options:**

**Option 1: Conduct Actual Discovery (15-20 minutes)**
If you're willing to answer systematic questions about your healthcare practice's specific needs, I can gather complete requirements and generate a comprehensive BRD. 

Would you like to start? First question: **What is the primary business objective this patient portal must achieve for your healthcare practice?** For example: (A) Reduce administrative burden on staff, (B) Improve patient satisfaction scores, or (C) Ensure regulatory compliance while minimizing risk?

**Option 2: Generate Incomplete Draft with Major Gaps**
I can create a skeletal BRD based solely on your initial statement, but it will be filled with assumptions, placeholders, and notation that critical information is missing.

**Which option do you want?**
