# Document Quality Evaluation Report

## Metadata
- **Document:** `business_requirements_document_-_transcript_analysis_extraction_2026-02-09.md`
- **Type:** Business Requirements Document (BRD) (95% confidence)
- **Mode:** Full
- **Evaluator:** BA Document Quality Evaluator v1.0
- **Date:** 2026-02-09
- **Generated By:** BA Assistant (Gemini provider via `ai_service.py`)

## Executive Summary
- **Overall Score: 78/100 — Usable with Fixes**
- Critical: 2 | Major: 5 | Minor: 4

This BRD demonstrates strong structural maturity with all 13 standard sections present, measurable KPIs, a stakeholder analysis table, and a clear current-vs-future state comparison. However, it suffers from recurring anti-patterns: a duplicate document title, stale metadata date (October 2023 for a 2026 document), hardcoded business values that should be configurable, and several acceptance criteria that mix user story format into BRD requirements. The compliance section is solid but the NFR coverage is narrow — no availability, capacity, or accessibility targets.

## Defect Catalog

### Critical Defects

#### DEF-001: Duplicate Document Title
- **Location:** Lines 1-2
- **Evidence:** `"# Business Requirements Document - Transcript Analysis & Extraction"` followed immediately by `"# Business Requirements Document - AI-Powered Transcript Analysis & Requirement Extraction"`
- **Problem:** Two H1 headers create document ambiguity. Which is the canonical title? Parsers and table-of-contents generators will break.
- **Why It Matters:** A document that can't identify itself unambiguously fails the most basic structural test. Downstream systems indexing this document will create duplicate entries.
- **Impact:** Document identity confusion, broken TOC generation, duplicate indexing.

#### DEF-002: Stale Metadata Date
- **Location:** Line 8
- **Evidence:** `"**Date:** October 24, 2023"`
- **Problem:** This document was generated on 2026-02-09. The date is hallucinated — over 2 years in the past. This is a recurring pattern (seen in evaluations #2 and #3).
- **Why It Matters:** Stakeholders reviewing this BRD will question its validity. Version control becomes impossible when the document claims to be from 2023.
- **Impact:** Loss of trust, version confusion, compliance audit failures.

### Major Defects

#### DEF-003: Hardcoded Business Values
- **Location:** Section 2, Line 18
- **Evidence:** `"BAs currently spend approximately 45 minutes for every hour of meeting recorded"`
- **Problem:** "45 minutes" is a hardcoded assumption presented as fact. No source cited. Different organizations will have different baselines.
- **Why It Matters:** A developer reading this will build the system around a 45-minute baseline. If the actual baseline is 30 minutes or 60 minutes, the success metrics (Section 9) become meaningless.
- **Impact:** Success criteria built on unverified assumptions.

#### DEF-004: Mixed Format in Acceptance Criteria
- **Location:** Section 6.2, Line 71; Section 6.3, Line 81; Section 6.4, Line 92
- **Evidence:** `"As a BA, I want the system to flag potential PII so that I can ensure client privacy before analysis."` inside a BRD requirement's acceptance criteria.
- **Problem:** User story format ("As a... I want... so that...") is leaking into BRD acceptance criteria. A BRD should state what the system SHALL do, not frame it as a user desire. This conflates two document types.
- **Why It Matters:** BRDs and User Stories serve different audiences. BRDs are for stakeholder sign-off on scope; User Stories are for development teams. Mixing formats confuses both audiences.
- **Impact:** Ambiguous document purpose, reviewer confusion.

#### DEF-005: Inconsistent Complexity Scale
- **Location:** Sections 6.1-6.5
- **Evidence:** Complexity values: `M`, `L`, `XL`, `M`, `S`
- **Problem:** No definition of the complexity scale. What does M mean vs L? Is L larger or smaller than M? Standard T-shirt sizing is XS < S < M < L < XL, but this isn't stated anywhere.
- **Why It Matters:** A PM reading "Complexity: L" has no basis for estimation. Without a legend, complexity is decorative, not informative.
- **Impact:** Unusable for sprint planning or effort estimation.

#### DEF-006: Missing Persona in User Flow 5.2
- **Location:** Section 5.2, Line 46
- **Evidence:** `"**Actor:** BA (Any level)"`
- **Problem:** "Any level" contradicts the detailed persona definitions in Section 4. Each flow should map to a specific persona. A Junior BA's redaction workflow will differ from a Senior BA's (review depth, confidence in decisions).
- **Why It Matters:** If all personas have the same flow, why define 4 distinct personas? The flow should acknowledge persona-specific variations.
- **Impact:** Persona definitions become decorative rather than functional.

#### DEF-007: Incomplete Risk Matrix
- **Location:** Section 12
- **Evidence:** Only 3 risks listed: AI Hallucination, Privacy Breach, Low Accuracy
- **Problem:** Missing critical operational risks: (1) What if the AI provider is unavailable? (2) What if transcript volume exceeds system capacity? (3) What about user adoption resistance? (4) What about integration failures with Zoom/Teams/Otter APIs?
- **Why It Matters:** A risk matrix with 3 entries for a feature this complex signals incomplete analysis. The mitigation strategies are also vague — "fine-tuning extraction prompts" is not a concrete mitigation.
- **Impact:** Unmitigated risks will surface during implementation.

### Minor Defects

#### DEF-008: Vague Success Criterion Timeline
- **Location:** Section 3, Line 24
- **Evidence:** `"within 90 days of deployment"` and `"within 6 months"`
- **Problem:** "Deployment" is undefined. Is this the first beta release? GA? Per-customer deployment? The clock starts at different times depending on interpretation.
- **Why It Matters:** Without anchoring the timeline to a specific event, stakeholders will disagree on whether the target was met.

#### DEF-009: Missing Data Volume Specifications
- **Location:** Section 6.1
- **Evidence:** No mention of file size limits, concurrent upload limits, or storage requirements.
- **Problem:** What happens when someone uploads a 500MB transcript? What's the max concurrent uploads?
- **Why It Matters:** Without boundaries, the system has no basis for capacity planning.

#### DEF-010: Assumption Without Validation Plan
- **Location:** Section 11, Line 137
- **Evidence:** `"**Assumption:** Source transcripts (Zoom/Teams/Otter) provide at least basic speaker labeling."`
- **Problem:** This assumption is critical to Req 6.1 but has no validation plan. What if Otter exports don't include speaker labels? The entire parsing flow breaks.
- **Why It Matters:** Unvalidated assumptions are the #1 cause of late-stage requirement changes.

#### DEF-011: No Accessibility Requirements
- **Location:** Entire document
- **Evidence:** No mention of WCAG, screen readers, keyboard navigation, or accessibility standards.
- **Problem:** A document review interface used by BAs must be accessible. This is both a legal requirement (ADA/Section 508) and a usability requirement.
- **Why It Matters:** Retrofitting accessibility is 5-10x more expensive than designing for it from the start.

## Document Fixes

### FIX-001 → DEF-001
- **Current:** Two H1 headers on lines 1-2
- **Replace With:** Single title: `# Business Requirements Document - AI-Powered Transcript Analysis & Requirement Extraction`

### FIX-002 → DEF-002
- **Current:** `**Date:** October 24, 2023`
- **Replace With:** `**Date:** February 9, 2026`

### FIX-003 → DEF-003
- **Current:** `BAs currently spend approximately 45 minutes for every hour of meeting recorded`
- **Replace With:** `BAs currently spend approximately [BASELINE_DOCUMENTATION_TIME] minutes for every hour of meeting recorded (source: [cite internal time study or industry benchmark])`

### FIX-004 → DEF-004
- **Current:** `As a BA, I want the system to flag potential PII so that I can ensure client privacy before analysis.`
- **Replace With:** `The system SHALL automatically flag potential PII patterns and present them in a review interface before analysis processing begins.`

### FIX-005 → DEF-005
- **Current:** `**Complexity:** M` (no legend)
- **Replace With:** Add complexity legend after Section 5: `**Complexity Scale:** XS (< 1 day) | S (1-3 days) | M (3-5 days) | L (1-2 weeks) | XL (2+ weeks)`

### FIX-006 → DEF-006
- **Current:** `**Actor:** BA (Any level)`
- **Replace With:** `**Actor:** Junior BA (with mandatory review by Senior BA for regulated industries)`

## Prompt Improvements

### PROMPT-FIX-015: Enforce Single Document Title
- **Impact Score:** 48
- **Pattern:** Duplicate H1 headers (recurring — 4th occurrence across evaluations)
- **Change:** Rule already added (PROMPT-FIX-012) but still occurring. Verify enforcement in `ai_service.py` artifact generation.

### PROMPT-FIX-016: Ban User Story Format in BRD Acceptance Criteria
- **Impact Score:** 52
- **Pattern:** "As a [persona], I want..." appearing inside BRD requirement sections
- **Change:** Add to BRD generation rules: `"Acceptance criteria in BRDs must use SHALL/MUST format, not user story 'As a... I want...' format. User story format is reserved for User Story documents only."`

### PROMPT-FIX-017: Require Complexity Scale Legend
- **Impact Score:** 38
- **Pattern:** Complexity indicators without definition
- **Change:** Add to generation rules: `"If complexity indicators (S/M/L/XL) are used, include a legend defining each level in terms of estimated effort."`

## What's Working Well (Post-Prompt-Fix Assessment)

These patterns are present and correct — confirming PROMPT-FIX-009 through PROMPT-FIX-014 effectiveness:

1. **Complexity indicators present** (S/M/L/XL) — PROMPT-FIX-009 working
2. **Specific personas used** (Junior BA, Senior BA, PM, Consulting BA) — PROMPT-FIX-010 working
3. **No UI implementation leakage** — PROMPT-FIX-011 working
4. **Error/exception scenarios present** in P0 requirements — model natural behavior + prompt reinforcement
5. **Priority classification** (P0/P1) with business rationale — strong
6. **Stakeholder analysis** with concerns column — excellent
7. **KPIs with measurement methods** — mature pattern
8. **Current vs Future state** comparison — effective communication tool
